I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
