<p>You'll need a special garbage disposal if you home utilizes a septic tank and drain field. The unit must grind the waste even finer to prevent obstructions and permit the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. When, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but should then shift to galvanized. I am unsure why that need to be. It is also permitted to utilize black iron if it is most likely covered with a galvanized coating (which is basically a special paint"). PG&E often does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
