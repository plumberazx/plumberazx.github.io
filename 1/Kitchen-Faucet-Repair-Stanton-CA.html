<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct effect on your safety, convenience, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if relevant).

While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed against it will result in decapitation, it may scare a number of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience. When to repair: Under no circumstances should your toilet move when you press or sit on it.
