<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific new sinks, however these will be identified to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that need to likewise be well preserved to help avoid leaks and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to split and harden or merely be so squished that it does not fill the area along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. We strongly recommend likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
