There are two standard types of toilet flushing systems; both types conserve water by utilizing 1.6 gallons of water per flush.

Look for gravity-fed toilets providing high efficiency to efficiently and silently get rid of waste.</p>
<p>One manner in which commercial plumbing is the exact same as residential plumbing is that regular maintenance will help prevent severe problems from occurring in the first place. When you have a knowledgeable plumber come in and inspect the integrity of the system, you can have assurance knowing that all is well and the probability of a burst pipe or supported drain is small. Call Gene Johnson Plumbing & Heating to schedule your next industrial drain cleaning appointment.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain won't fix the problem. You might have to check out using a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
