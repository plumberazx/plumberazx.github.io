<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Since water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily kept for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
