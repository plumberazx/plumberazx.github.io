<p>Plastic pipe is in wide usage for domestic water system and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being practical to manufacture till 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed an approach to plasticize PVC, making it simpler to process.

<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
