<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than need (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
