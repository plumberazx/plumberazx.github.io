<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Clayton CA?</h3>
<p>Typical causes of problems in sewer lines are tree root invasion, blockages (such as foreign objects, bathroom tissue, grease, and other particles), degeneration, and broken seals or joints between areas of sewer line. House owners are responsible for maintaining, repairing, and replacing gas pipes that range from the energy's gas meter to the home's gas devices. When the source of a gas leak or other issue is on a client's natural gas pipe or related connections, repair costs can be high.</p>

<p>The term hard water" might seem like an oxymoron, but it's just household water which contains high concentrations of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. These minerals do not make water unhealthy to drink. They also are reasonably undetectable through odor or taste, but they can be harmful just the exact same. As with our trenchless services, we will first perform pipe leak tests utilizing video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
<p>If you have a newer unit, a simple repair or replacing specific parts might be all that's needed to get your hot water heater working again.
