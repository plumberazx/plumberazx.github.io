<p>To assist avoid clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the method laid out above. Because the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially true when the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
