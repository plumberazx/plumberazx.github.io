<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the very first check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. An RPBA works versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and might be used to separate health or non-health risks.</p>
