<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin.

<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design).

This process continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about completely regrowed.</p>
