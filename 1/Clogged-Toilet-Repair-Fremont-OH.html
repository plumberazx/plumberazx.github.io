<p>106.2.1 Repairing Leaks.

<p>Those people in the market know that cross-connection programs in lots of areas have actually significantly lowered the number of reported occurrences that occur within our water systems. This has at times led to individuals thinking that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there may never actually have actually been an issue in the first place. This thinking can be both unsafe and detrimental. Backflow events in water supply are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far a lot of areas we have an all or absolutely nothing technique to backflow defense. We need to take a look at each installation for the hazard it provides and then install the proper security.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high risk" facilities.</p>
