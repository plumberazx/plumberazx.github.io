<p>If you find a leak and choose a patching task instead of a repiping task, just keep in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the exact same product and they may be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to think about repiping your whole home when you spot a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backward.</p>
