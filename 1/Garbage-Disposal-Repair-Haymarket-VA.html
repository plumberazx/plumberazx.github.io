The typical usage for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be gently lubricated to guarantee they do not present of their retainer. Making use of excessive lubricant can cause the backflow prevention assembly to stop working or wear out earlier by attracting dirt and particles or restricting the movement of the element.
