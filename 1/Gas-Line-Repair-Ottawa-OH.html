<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Ottawa OH?</h3>
<p>Read your insurance coverage policy thoroughly if your polybutylene pipes have actually failed. Ensure you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurance companies will not cover a slow leak. Claims might be rejected due to the fact that the standard HO-3 property owners' policy specifically excludes "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged amount of time." Call your insurance coverage representative and validate your coverage. As soon as you have gone through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered, check with your representative to verify that your understanding is right.</p>
