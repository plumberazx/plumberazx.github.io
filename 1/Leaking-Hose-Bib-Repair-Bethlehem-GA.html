<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
