<p>When your water heater beings to weaken, you can see how it impacts your day-to-day convenience. With a water heater replacement, you'll solve your repair concerns, and have enhanced water heater efficiency too. The sodium uptake through softened water depends on the firmness of the water. Averagely, less than 3% salt uptake originates from drinking softened water. Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the hardness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide should be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.</p>

<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be eliminated by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin has already been fouled. Once again, it is suggested to inspect the producer's directions for unique safety measures.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the issue if this is the case. You might have to check out utilizing a high pressure water supply to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
