If you experience clogs and backups in your home more than a couple of times, it's a great concept to have a professional examine your drain system.

For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl.

Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We highly recommend likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
