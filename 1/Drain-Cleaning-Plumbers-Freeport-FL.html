Quick heating gas heaters, as a general guideline, will warm water far quicker than an electrical water heater of the exact same basic measurements and capability. An electric hot water heater may take a complete hour to heat 25 gallons, and a gas heater might warm two times that amount in the exact same given time and perhaps quicker.</p>
