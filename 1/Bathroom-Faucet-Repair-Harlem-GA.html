Water softening is the removal of calcium, magnesium, and specific other metal cations in hard water The resulting soft water requires less soap for the same cleaning effort, as soap is not wasted bonding with calcium ions.

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
