Plumbing- If you are setting up a toilet in a new or remodelled bathroom, installation might require plumbing adjustments, which will increase your total cost of installation.</p>

The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
