This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is essential to get rid of the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simpleness of its design and absence of moving parts. Nevertheless, it may be not practical in many scenarios to install a pipe sector of this length. Additionally, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
