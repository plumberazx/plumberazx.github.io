<p>Keep in mind: Copper piping in the Florida area is particularly susceptible to repeating pinhole leakages (corrosion that breaks through the surface area of piping), so keep an eye out for bluish-greenish corrosion on copper piping. Auto-reverse setting: Some waste disposal unit include this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This safeguards the blades so they don't break as quickly.

<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high threat" establishments.</p>
