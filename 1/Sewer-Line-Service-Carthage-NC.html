Usually, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires total water shut off while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience very little disruption to your everyday routine. To start the repiping process, the plumbing team will first cover any carpet and furniture to safeguard them from dust and debris. They will then make little cuts in the wall and drywall to locate the pipes and then remove and replace them, leaving as much of the initial structure product as possible undamaged.</p>
