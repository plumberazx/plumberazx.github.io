By replacing the bicarbonate, calcium, and magnesium ions that trigger water firmness with salt or potassium ions, the EC4 softens hard water by resolving its source. In addition, thanks to its special, built-in microprocessor, the EC4 system will discover your typical water usage patterns, changing its soft water shipment based upon your needs.

<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.

To prevent this, make sure the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or purchase one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
