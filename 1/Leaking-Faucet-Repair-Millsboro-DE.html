<p>An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes 2 independently acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and listed below the very first check valve.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
