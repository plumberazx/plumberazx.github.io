<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner package. The total repair costs might be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater. To ensure that we are providing top quality work and client peace of mind, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to safely perform hot water heater replacements. In addition to conventional water heaters, we also install tankless water heaters, and heatpump water heaters.</p>
