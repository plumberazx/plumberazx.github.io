<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your home.

Salt is normally utilized in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
