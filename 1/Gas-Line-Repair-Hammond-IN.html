<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Hammond IN</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>A. We highly suggest a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers block any water from unfavorable or back pressure in your watering system at shutdown from entering back into your water source, therefore lowering the threat of contamination of your water source. Numerous municipalities need the use of an approved backflow preventer in drip watering systems. You might wish to talk to your local municipality before installing your watering system.</p>
