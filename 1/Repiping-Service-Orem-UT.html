<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Orem UT</h3>
<p>If you notice your water bill increasing, it might be a leak you can't see. Call us for our leak detection service today. If you see absolutely nothing obvious, place the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the system, and twist right and left. Examine that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then attempt the reset button if the motor spins freely. If these procedures do not work, and your disposer's guarantee has actually expired, it's time to replace it.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a various design from the one we reveal, examine the instructions. After installing the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

Using the incorrect fitting could trigger an obstruction or leak.</p>
