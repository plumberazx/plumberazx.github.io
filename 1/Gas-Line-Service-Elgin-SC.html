<p>Insects. Unfortunately, a damaged main sewer line can also lead to unwanted bugs inside your home. Bugs and rats can quickly squeeze through fractures and gaps in your sewer line and discover their method into your plumbing. These bugs can be extremely hazardous to your health. A plumber can perform a visual inspection of your sewer line if you think you have insects in your plumbing. Eliminate the drain basket and surround the sink hole with a coil of plumber. Air space backflow systems, as the name recommends, have an air space in between the water supply system and the receiving vessel. The air gap avoids non-potable water from receding to the clean water system system.</p>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
