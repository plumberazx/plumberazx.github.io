<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs.
