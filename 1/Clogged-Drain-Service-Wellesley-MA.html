<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Because I love to cook, I produce a whole lot of dishes. We set up a momentary workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we recognized that we needed the sink fixed ASAP.

If it obstructs once again within that time, he will come out and fix it totally free - that is what I call service!
