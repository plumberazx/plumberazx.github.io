These are centers created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never precisely matches supply.
