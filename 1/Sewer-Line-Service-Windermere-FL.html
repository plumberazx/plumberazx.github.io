<p>This is a totally valid concern that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, naturally, as important as your hot water heater, water line, or drains. However, it adds a fair amount of performance to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a reasonably little round device set up under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal system pulls down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such particles. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
