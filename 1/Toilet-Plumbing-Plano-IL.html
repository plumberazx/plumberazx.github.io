<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the phone a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
<p>3. Banging or snapping noises - Over sufficient time, there could be substantial sediment built-up in your hot water heater that can produce this snapping or popping noise that can be pretty loud.
