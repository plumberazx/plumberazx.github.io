<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
