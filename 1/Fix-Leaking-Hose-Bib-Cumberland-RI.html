<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
