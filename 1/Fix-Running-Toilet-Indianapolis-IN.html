However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older house (built pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.

<p>Lots of toilet problems, including leaking toilets, do not necessitate fixing the whole toilet. Like any home appliance, a toilet tank includes many small moving parts that may need replaced with usage over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and cause toilet leakages that aren't plainly visible to the naked eye.

<p>For whole-house repiping, the choice generally comes down to copper or PEX (cross-linked polyethylene). This plastic piping is resilient and less costly than copper. PEX is simple to install, which suggests the cost of installation might be low too. There is some danger of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is rare. In basic, it's a cost-efficient service that will stand the test of time. We frequently suggest this material, though it will depend.</p>
