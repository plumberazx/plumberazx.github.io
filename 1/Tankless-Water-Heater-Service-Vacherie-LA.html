I would highly recommend the Clog Dawg for an once or yearly inspection if you believe that roots might be triggering havoc in your drainage pipes.</p>
<p>Both methods are extremely effective and minimizing waste and clearing it. The most significant difference is in timing. With a batch disposal, you fill the unit, cover it, then turn it on.
