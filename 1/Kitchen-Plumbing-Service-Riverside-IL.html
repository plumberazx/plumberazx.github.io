<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
