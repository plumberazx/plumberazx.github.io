<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it must put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank replenished.</p>
