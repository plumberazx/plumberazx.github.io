Over time, the beads end up being covered with minerals and need to be cleaned up. This cleaning process, called regrowth, has three cycles: recharge, rinse and backwash. The regrowth process can be scheduled automatically with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
