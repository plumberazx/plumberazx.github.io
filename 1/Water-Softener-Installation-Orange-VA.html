<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water created in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
