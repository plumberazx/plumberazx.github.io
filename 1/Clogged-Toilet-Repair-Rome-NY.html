<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
