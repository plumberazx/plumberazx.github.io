<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
