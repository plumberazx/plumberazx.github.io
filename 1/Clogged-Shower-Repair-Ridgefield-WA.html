The minerals end up being caught and attached to the resin as the salt is released into the water, thus removing them and softening the water. There's an excellent possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions.

The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
