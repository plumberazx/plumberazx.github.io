<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when.

Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>

When the pressure drops for some reason such as might occur when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to fight a water or a fire main breaks or some other situation happens, polluted water may be drawn into the system. To prevent such an incident, there requires to be some type of backflow prevention technique utilized. The best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air gap is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is required. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>
<p>A reduction in supply side pressure triggered by an event such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire combating, causes the supply pressure to drop below the client side pressure.

Water will discharge till the supply side pressure again goes beyond the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
