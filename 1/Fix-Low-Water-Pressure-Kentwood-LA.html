As soon as an individual becomes a certified tester, there is a great chance the individual understands how to test a backflow preventer. Regrettably, this does not mean the individual understands how to repair a backflow preventer. Sometimes it is presumed if you can evaluate them, you can repair them. This is not true. The repair service technician has a long list of things he must find out to be able to repair a backflow prevention assembly and return it to its initial factory specifications.</p>
<p>Those people in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in many areas have vastly decreased the variety of reported events that happen within our water supply. This has at times led to people thinking that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there might never really have been an issue in the very first place. This thinking can be both disadvantageous and unsafe. Backflow events in water systems are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a lowered pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many areas we have an all or absolutely nothing technique to backflow security. We need to take a look at each installation for the threat it presents and after that install the proper defense.</p>
