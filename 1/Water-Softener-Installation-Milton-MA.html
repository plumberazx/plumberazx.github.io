<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange install) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange).

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
