<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Coarsegold CA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system needs to be continuously kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
