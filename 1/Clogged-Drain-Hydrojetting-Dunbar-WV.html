This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (normally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
