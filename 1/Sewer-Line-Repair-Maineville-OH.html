<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems.

Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
