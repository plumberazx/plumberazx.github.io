<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water circulation. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite circulation is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to escape. Sometimes no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down lead to a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
