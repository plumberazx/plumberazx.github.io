<p>In a lot of cases, pipe relining is great alternative to replacing your sewer pipes. There are four kinds of pipe relining systems to effectively finish the job. All the products will rehabilitate the interior of your pipes without needing to totally replace them. How old is the plumbing in your home? Well, first let's ask you a different concern: How old is your house? If it was developed prior to 1970, it might have pipes made from an out-of-date product that will begin to offer you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they have not already). And if your home was built prior to The second world war, then it likely needs replacements for its old pipes, probably whole-house repiping.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
