<p>Service Plumbing and Heating supplies quality commercial and residential plumbing and heating services to Seattle, Shoreline, Lynnwood, Bellevue, Kirkland and surrounding areas. Continuous feed garbage disposals are the most typical, and the type most plumbers recommend. They're wired to an ON and OFF switch, found either under the sink or on a neighboring wall.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps require it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
