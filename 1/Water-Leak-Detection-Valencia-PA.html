<p>Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of minimized pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is developed to release and open water to the exterior.

For this factor, the RPZ should be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and enable adequate drainage.</p>

A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Often a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
