<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Toilet efficiency- The higher the efficiency of the toilet, the more it costs. The efficiency of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more effective your toilet is. Discover if there are any lead pipes in the house.

You may not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>A clogged pipe can likewise allow water to leak into a structure. This not only deteriorates the structural stability of a building, but it can also let water in through the floorboards, triggering them to deteriorate and stain gradually.
