<p>Regardless of the Romans' common use of lead pipes, their aqueducts hardly ever poisoned individuals. Unlike other parts of the world where lead pipes cause poisoning, the Roman water had so much calcium in it that a layer of plaque prevented the water contacting the lead itself. What frequently causes confusion is the large amount of evidence of widespread lead poisoning, especially among those who would have had simple access to piped water, 19 an unfortunate result of lead being used in pots and pans and as an additive to processed food and drink (for instance as a preservative in white wine). 20 Roman lead pipe inscriptions supplied info on the owner to prevent water theft.</p>

<p>Conditioned or softened water is fantastic for your family's health. Make gas connections with solid steel pipe (Picture 8) or soft copper with flare fittings (Fig. A).
