As with our trenchless services, we will first carry out pipe leak tests using video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is totally removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, specifically in locations where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main cause of the blue and green spots being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. Most residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it.
