The city or Uruk contains the oldest known examples of brick built Latrines, constructed atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had exchangeable and quickly removable sectors, and allowed for cleaning.</p>
<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high danger" facilities.</p>
