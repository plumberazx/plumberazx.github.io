<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
<p>Water softening is the removal of calcium, magnesium, and specific other metal cations in hard water. The resulting soft water is more suitable with soap and extends the life time of some appliances. Water softening is usually accomplished using ion-exchange resins. The waste disposal unit is leaking from below your sink. Press the tip of a screwdriver up against the edge of the plug and tap up until you break out the plug. Then eliminate this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can most likely hold the system upside down and shake it out).</p>
