<p>The garbage disposal is an exceptionally practical function, however it's something that should not be overlooked in regards to care and maintenance. Many individuals do not treat their garbage disposals properly, which can lead to all sort of concerns. This, in turn, can not only result in the waste disposal unit no longer operating efficiently or effectively, but can also lead to issues with other fixtures and plumbing systems.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to push the phone a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the install ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
