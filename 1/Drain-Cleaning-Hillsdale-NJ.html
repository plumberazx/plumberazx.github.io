<p>The term tough water" might sound like an oxymoron, however it's simply household water that contains high concentrations of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium.

<p>So, how does a softener know when to get down to company? The timing of regrowth depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water really needs it. When required, newer systems use electronic sensing units that monitor bead deficiency and other crucial metrics based on your water use and therefore just regrow. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal since they conserve energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
