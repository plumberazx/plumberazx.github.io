<p>An rdc is similar to a DC in that it is a mechanical backflow preventer consisting of 2 separately acting, spring-loaded check valves. However, it generally does not consist of shutoff valves, may or may not be geared up with test cocks or ports, and is generally less reliable than a DC. An rdc works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but ought to be utilized to separate only nonhealth dangers and is intended for usage only in water service connections to single-family homes.</p>
<p>Although the professional agreed that the client did the best thing in her efforts to tighten up the pipes, the technician saw that the pipe had become incredibly corroded over the years and that a PVC pipe might be much better matched for the client's requirements.

Prior to leaving the home, the service technician brought back water flow and tested the pipe.</p>
