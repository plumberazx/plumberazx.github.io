<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Clifton VA?</h3>
<p>A malfunctioning waste disposal unit, grease buildup, collected food and more can all add to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will cause problems.

For the more serious clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Wingate plumber.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank including countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is heated, tough water causes white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to lower these symptoms.</p>
