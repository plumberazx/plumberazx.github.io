It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
