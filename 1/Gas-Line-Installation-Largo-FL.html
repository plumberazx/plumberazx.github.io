<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The most basic backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is necessary to get rid of the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its design and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it may be impractical in many scenarios to install a pipe sector of this length. Furthermore, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
