A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Often a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger.

<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
