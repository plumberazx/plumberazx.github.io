<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for most construction contractors (or their workers). The sewer and drain systems of your home or business, is an integral part of your daily life.

<p>Water softeners typically use sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are provided from dissolved sodium chloride salt, also called salt water. In the ion exchange procedure, salt ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that look like damp sand. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to potential contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>

<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your house. When the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it must be restored (cleaned). Salt is typically utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
