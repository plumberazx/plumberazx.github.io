When one immediately starts regeneration after adding salt to the reservoir, the water softener might not work according to standards. After an approval of plans has been provided and the assembly has been set up, it should be checked by a certified tester. The designer (or water supplier) is then accountable to certify that the installation was done in accordance with approved plans; or explain any changes or send "As Built" plans as appropriate.</p>
