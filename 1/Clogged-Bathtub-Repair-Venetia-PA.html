<p>During typical operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of decreased pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the outside. An RPZ will occasionally discharge small amounts of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ ought to be installed in locations that are exempt to water damage and enable sufficient drainage.</p>

<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 indicators of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up gradually, they gradually start to restrict the circulation of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you observe it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, affecting your water quality.</p>
