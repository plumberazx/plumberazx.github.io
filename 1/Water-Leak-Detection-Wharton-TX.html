<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
