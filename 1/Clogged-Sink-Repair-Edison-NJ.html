The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to escape.
