<p>To help prevent obstructions within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the approach laid out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up because the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. This is specifically true when the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
