<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water passes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is generally utilized in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
<p>Polybutylene pipes were utilized in some homes around twenty to forty years back. These pipes susceptible and very unreliable to failure.
