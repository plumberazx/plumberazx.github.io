It may be due to a corroded hot water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your home if this takes place only when your hot water is running.</p>
<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best used in critical locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
