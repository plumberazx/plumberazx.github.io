Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the office number noted on the building license. Inspections need to be made after structure excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon completion. NOTE: If faulty work is discovered, the inspector will provide an offense notification, and a particular time period is allotted to fix the problem.</p>

You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
