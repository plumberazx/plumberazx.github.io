<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
