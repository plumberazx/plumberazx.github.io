<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

<p>A reduction in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire combating, causes the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve enables the excess consumer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge until the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is warmed directly whenever it's needed. When the tap is changed on, tankless systems particularly make use of an aspect that heats up water. The water is continuously heated as long as the tap stays on. If the tap is immediately switched off, the water stops being warmed. The heating temperature level is usually pre-set to suit your preferences and needs. Due to the fact that they only heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters utilize less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
