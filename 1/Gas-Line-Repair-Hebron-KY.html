<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly restored, the beads end up being filled with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As tough water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. Tough water triggers gray or white deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these symptoms.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually already been fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Again, it is recommended to check the maker's guidelines for unique preventative measures.</p>
