<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect in time, they gradually begin to restrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much buildup to occur, so by the time you observe it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, impacting your water quality.</p>
