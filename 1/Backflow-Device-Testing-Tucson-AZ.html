When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very important here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard against back pressure.

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals.
