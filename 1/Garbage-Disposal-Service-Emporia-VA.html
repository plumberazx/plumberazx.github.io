Underground gas line installation needs piping that satisfies specific requirements, and this generally costs more than non-underground tasks.</p>
<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
