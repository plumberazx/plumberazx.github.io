Older toilets might work simply fine, however if your toilet is truly old (and dated in design), you may want to think about a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.

However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers carry just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more.
