<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>During the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine passes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
