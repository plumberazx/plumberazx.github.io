<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Greenbrier TN?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system must be continuously kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
