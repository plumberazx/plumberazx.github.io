<p>Like any major appliance, your hot water heater will begin to wear down and reveal signs of aging. Most property owners begin experiencing concerns with their hot water heater around the 10-year mark, so if the water heater in your house was currently set up when you bought it, then you might need dependable water heater replacement and installation services.

This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
