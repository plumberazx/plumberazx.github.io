<p>If you need a brand-new toilet, the cost largely depends on the toilet you pick. Toilets vary in style, flushing performance and bowl shape, all of that make some toilets more costly than others. When setting up a new toilet, the plumber may also need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the job. We have all the parts essential to fix your toilet. It only takes a short time if we have to purchase them. Toilets are often neglected, but they are among the most important components in a home. Anybody who wants to upgrade, fix or just change a toilet should speak with a Cal's Plumbing toilet professional before they start.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close.
