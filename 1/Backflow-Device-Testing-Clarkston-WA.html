Replacing the pipes in your house is essential for maintaining a healthy functioning water supply and a general optimal house plumbing system. Low water pressure and pipes made out of galvanized steel cause higher levels of rust and deterioration. These incidents also adversely affect your home's plumbing and can result in higher concerns that can be avoided with the suitable pipe replacement.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the problem. You might need to check out using a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
