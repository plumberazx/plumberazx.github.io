<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
