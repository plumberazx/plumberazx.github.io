<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
