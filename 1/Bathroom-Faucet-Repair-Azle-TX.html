<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Azle TX</h3>

I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
