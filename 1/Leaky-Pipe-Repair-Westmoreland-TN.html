Choosing a greater priced plumber typically pays off in the long run, though.

<p>Keep in mind: Copper piping in the Florida area is particularly vulnerable to repeating pinhole leakages (corrosion that breaks through the surface area of piping), so watch out for bluish-greenish corrosion on copper piping.
