Technical direction includes safety, local plumbing codes and regulations, and plan reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and businesses. Most apprentices get in a program straight, but some start out as helpers or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
