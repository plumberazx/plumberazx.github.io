<p>A water heater installation is not the repair on which to hone your plumbing abilities if you're reasonably inexperienced. So save yourself some serious trouble by being sincere with yourself about where your experience level is. Many backflow preventers are developed to enable the parts to be removed for repair while the main body stays set up in the piping system. Removing the backflow preventer to repair it is not necessary in most cases. Some components such as relief valve bodies may need to be gotten rid of from the main body to facilitate a repair. Knowing the right order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to help avoid leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and crack or just be so squished that it doesn't fill the area in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure whatever remains in tip-top shape.</p>
