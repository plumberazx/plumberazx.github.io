For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
