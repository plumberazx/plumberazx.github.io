<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
