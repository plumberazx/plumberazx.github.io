<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Middlebury CT?</h3>
<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the drinkable water supply and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An approved, correctly installed and preserved backflow assembly basically removes the risk of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric hot water heater have a shorter life-span than gas water heaters of similar quality and capability. Still, the distinction is inadequate to make any substantial changes in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater might last 8-15 years, the electrical alternative will last about 8-12 years.</p>
