<p>If you're fairly unskilled, a water heater installation is not the repair on which to sharpen your plumbing skills. So save yourself some serious problem by being truthful with yourself about where your experience level is. Many backflow preventers are designed to permit the components to be gotten rid of for repair while the main body stays installed in the piping system.

Knowing the right order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
