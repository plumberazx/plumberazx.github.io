<p>Keep your kitchen plumbing running efficiently and discover replacing and keeping faucets, waste disposal unit and more. Communication abilities.

When the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
