Ask how long the inspection usually takes when you call to arrange your visit.</p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Information Inspection (authorization) is to have the plumbing contractor consult with an inspector at the task site to review a proposed installation, which may not be in conformance with the code. The proposition to deviate from the code is sent in duplicate, in composing or with readable illustrations, and states the factor for discrepancy. The proposal might be considered and authorized, if it fulfills the intent of the plumbing code.</p>
