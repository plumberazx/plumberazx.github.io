<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>In addition, you should constantly run cold water while the waste disposal unit is on to make sure that food bits are fully pressed through. Warm water can cause things like grease, oil, and starches to pass and melt through the disposal, but they will only solidify even more on down the drain, potentially causing a clog. Of course, even with correct use, waste disposal unit are subject to routine wear and tear. No matter the reason your garbage disposal has stopped working, you can depend on Preferred Home Services for quickly, affordable garbage disposal repairs in Charleston.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the very first most obvious signs of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be).

No matter whether it is an electric water heater or a gas hot water heater, Premier Plumbing has actually offered water heater repair and installation service in the Hampton Roadways area since 1978.</p>
