So it's a. good time to think about getting a brand name brand-new toilet. A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it actually presses into the clog, working even more into where the obstruction is happening.

Licensing normally requires an examination or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board to find out more.</p>
