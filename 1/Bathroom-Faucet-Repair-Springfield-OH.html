<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance.
