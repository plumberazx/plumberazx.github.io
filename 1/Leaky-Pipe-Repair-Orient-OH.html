<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas beverages. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made of copper.

The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
