But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many house centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
