<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water. Many water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>

<p>A normal water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
