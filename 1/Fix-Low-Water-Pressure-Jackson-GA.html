<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Jackson GA?</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains considerable amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its many desired usages around your house.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
