<p>This is an entirely valid question that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, obviously, as important as your hot water heater, water line, or drains. However, it includes a fair quantity of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a relatively small round device set up under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily flow into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
