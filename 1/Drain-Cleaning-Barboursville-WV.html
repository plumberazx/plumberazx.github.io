<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
