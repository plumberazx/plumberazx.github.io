<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Once again, it is a good idea to inspect the manufacturer's instructions for special preventative measures.</p>
<p>There are other advantages to water softening, as well. It is a well established technology that has actually been utilized in homes for nearly 65 years. The equipment is reliable, efficient, and extensively available, supplying consumers with hassle-free functions and a selective market. The easy innovation of softening makes it simple to bypass toilets and outdoor faucets. Lastly softening systems are adaptable for mixing unsoftened and softened water to produce a lower solidity level.</p>
