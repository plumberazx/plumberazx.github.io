Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if expensive) device is best utilized in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
