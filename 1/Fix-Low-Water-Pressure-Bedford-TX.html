<p>Lubrication may help with the placement of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly.

The typical usage for lubricant in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings must be gently lubed to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. Using excessive lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to stop working or wear out earlier by attracting dirt and particles or restricting the motion of the component.
