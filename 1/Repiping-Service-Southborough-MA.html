<p>We concentrate on storm drain inspections and cleaning. Softened water is not advised for watering house lawns, plants and gardens due to its salt content. Water used in recharging a water softener may overload or lower the efficiency of small septic or sewer systems. Sodium consumption might posture health threats. Softened water is not suggested for steam irons or evaporative coolers. The best choice for such home appliances is pure water or water from a reverse osmosis unit.

<p>The specialists at RupCoe Plumbing, Heating & A/c are here to assist property owners in South Plainfield, NJ with our drain cleaning company. We equip them with the right tools and products to take care of any persistent clogs so water can resume flowing efficiently throughout your home's plumbing system. You'll need a power cable, which you can usually get rid of from the old disposal and reuse. Make certain to check out the maker's installation directions.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be eliminated by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually already been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Once again, it is recommended to examine the producer's instructions for special precautions.</p>
