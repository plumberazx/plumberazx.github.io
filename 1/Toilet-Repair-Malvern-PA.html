<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
