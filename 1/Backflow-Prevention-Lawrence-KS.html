<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of keeping the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Many states need plumbers to be licensed.

Salt does not have the chance to enter drinking water through softening installations.</p>
<p>Water softeners usually use sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are provided from liquified sodium chloride salt, also called brine. In the ion exchange procedure, salt ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that resemble damp sand. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to possible contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>

<p>When replacing an under-sink assembly, look for quality products. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, along with flexible rubber traps.
