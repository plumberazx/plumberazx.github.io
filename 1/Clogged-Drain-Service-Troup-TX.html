<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your house.

Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
