<p>. Leaking Joints: The seals between pipes have decomposed or broken, permitting water to escape into the ground surrounding the pipes. Examine the sewer lines from home to suppress connection, sewage-disposal tank, and drainage systems to thoroughly examine if pipe damage, rust, or major blockages are present. Tree roots are among the most significant reasons for a sewer line backup. As roots enter into the drain line they can trigger blockages and back up into your house.</p>

That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be gotten rid of by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has currently been fouled. Once again, it is advisable to examine the manufacturer's guidelines for special preventative measures.</p>
