<p>With drain line cleaning, you know your pipes are sparkly clean. With repairs, you understand they remain in good shape. And with lining, you know they'll be safe and secure for years to come. As a house owner or business owner, those peace of minds can be very, really nice to hear. We service pipelines throughout the state of Georgia, from Atlanta to Athens, Savannah to Augusta, Macon to Marietta, GA, and beyond. The images provide a sample of a backflow device located behind the water meter.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
