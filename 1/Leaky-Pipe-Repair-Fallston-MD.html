<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt when freshly restored. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. Hard water causes white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be used to minimize these signs.</p>
<p>Difficult water stops washing detergents and cosmetic cleansers from working as successfully. When washing items are utilized in tough water - difficult water ions bond with surfactants making them not available to bond with water.
