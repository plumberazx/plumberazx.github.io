<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its numerous intended uses around your house.</p>

<p>The check assembly was developed in the 1950s for the fire protection market, developing a redundancy designed to make sure that one check valve will continue to protect the city water system even if the other stops working.

Test dicks, or little ball valves, enable the attachment of testing devices that evaluates whether the double check assembly is practical.</p>
