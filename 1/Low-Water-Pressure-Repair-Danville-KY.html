Many water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
