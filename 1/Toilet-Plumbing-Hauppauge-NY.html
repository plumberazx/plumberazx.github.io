<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
