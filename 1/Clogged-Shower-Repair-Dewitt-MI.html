<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
