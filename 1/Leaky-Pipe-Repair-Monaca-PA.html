<p>There are 2 popular install systems utilized for garbage disposers: the basic 3-bolt mount (if you have actually had a disposer installed for some time, it's probably installed this way) and a more recent system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a comparable system called "Quick Lock").

<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this brine passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
