<p>Backflow preventers should only be repaired when the data collected from the field test shows the assembly has actually deteriorated in its efficiency listed below the developed minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if essential, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This indicates the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
