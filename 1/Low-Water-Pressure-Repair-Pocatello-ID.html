<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Inspect the directions if your valve is a different design from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
