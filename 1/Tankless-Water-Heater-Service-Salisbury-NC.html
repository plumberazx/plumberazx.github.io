If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve.
