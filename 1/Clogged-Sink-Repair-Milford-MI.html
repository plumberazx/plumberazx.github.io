Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things in a different way could have conserved her a lot of cash. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then unfavorable pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
