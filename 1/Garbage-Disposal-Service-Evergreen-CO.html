<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Sadly, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
