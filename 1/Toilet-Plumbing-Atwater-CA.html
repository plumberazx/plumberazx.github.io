<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of utilize the method laid out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. This is especially real when the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free.
