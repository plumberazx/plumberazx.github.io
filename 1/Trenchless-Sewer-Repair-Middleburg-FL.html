This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital locations in the assembly.

This procedure continues until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regenerated.</p>
