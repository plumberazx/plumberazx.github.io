A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve permits the excess consumer side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge.

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that should also be well kept to assist avoid leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl.

We highly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
