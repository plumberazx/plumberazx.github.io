Call (866) 701-5306 to schedule a visit. An atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not frequently defined by water purveyors.  It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional usage, water pressure pushes the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.
