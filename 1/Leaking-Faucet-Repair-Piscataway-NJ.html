<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent to drain. This procedure continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about totally regenerated.</p>
