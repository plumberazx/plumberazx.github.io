The test period shall not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall withstand the test pressure specified without revealing any evidence of leak or other problems. Mechanical determines used to determine test pressures will have a range such that the highest end of the scale is not greater than five times the test pressure. For example, a 3 psi test will require a maximum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be performed utilizing a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection.
