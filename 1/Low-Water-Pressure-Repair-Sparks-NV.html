It may not be set up in any place where it might ever be immersed under water. Some towns do not permit the usage of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some do not enable the use of a PVB at all, so consult your water provider. A PVB backflow preventer may spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow takes place, so it needs to be installed in a location where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>
