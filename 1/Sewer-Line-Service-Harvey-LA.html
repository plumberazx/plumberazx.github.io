However, it typically does not include shutoff valves, might or may not be geared up with test cocks or ports, and is normally less reliable than a DC. An rdc is effective against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but should be utilized to isolate just nonhealth hazards and is meant for usage only in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>

Repiping now will give you peace of mind and avoid bigger leaks down the roadway.</p>
