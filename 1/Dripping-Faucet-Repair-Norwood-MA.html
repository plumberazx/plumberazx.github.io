<p>Hot water heater failures cause millions of dollars in water damages every year. Bear in mind that when choosing your brand-new commercial water heater, you get what you pay for. While seemingly a deal, a water heater rated for just 7 years is typically most likely to fail before you recover your investment. Take a look at the cost per ranked year to make an educated choice.

<p>Sadly, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it frequently ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, specifically in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main cause of the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas water heaters with unique venting systems also are available. But they're more difficult to install, and we will not deal with them here.</p>
