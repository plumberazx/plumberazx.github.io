<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>

It might be due to a rusty hot water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your house if this takes place just when your hot water is running.</p>

Lightweight materials and compact construction devices reduce the cost of repair and reduce environmental damage.

It will be much better to live with a new, more effective system than to spend on frequent repairs.</p>

This kind of circumstance might take place if a contractor is dealing with an individual's landscaping and unintentionally rupture a line. A property owner's policy might cover this kind of repair.
