The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to escape. Often no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose shut down results in a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>

Consumer Private investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get an estimate from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement.
