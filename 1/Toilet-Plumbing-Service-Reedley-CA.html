<p>A water softener has a resin tank including countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads end up being loaded with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As tough water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. When water is warmed, hard water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to reduce these symptoms.</p>
