Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>

<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately constant, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily kept for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
