<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- destructive.

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (normally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
