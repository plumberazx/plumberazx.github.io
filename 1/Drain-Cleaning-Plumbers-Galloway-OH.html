Technical direction includes safety, local plumbing codes and policies, and plan reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and services. Many apprentices enter a program directly, however some start out as assistants or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
