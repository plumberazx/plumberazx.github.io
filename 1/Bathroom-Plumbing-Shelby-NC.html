<p>Disconnect system from electrical, drain and sink. Eliminate and dispose of system. Backflow is the unwanted flow of water or other liquids, mixes, gasses or compounds into the drinking water system. In most states, other than Kansas, you are responsible for any gas piping on your home from our gas meter to your house or company. Atmos Energy does not keep the natural gas lines on your residential or commercial property beyond our meter, this is the exact same as other utilities, such as your electrical circuitry and pipes.</p>
<p>In community water system systems, water is usually preserved at a significant pressure to allow water to flow to and out of the plumbing components in your house or business. When the pressure drops for some reason such as might occur when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to eliminate a water or a fire main breaks or some other scenario takes place, polluted water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an event, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention method utilized. The very best and safest kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). The appropriate backflow prevention device is needed if an air gap is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water supplier.</p>
