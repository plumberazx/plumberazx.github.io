<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the install ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that ought to likewise be well kept to help prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to crack and harden or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape.</p>
