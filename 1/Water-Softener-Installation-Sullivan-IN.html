The test period shall not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system will endure the test pressure specified without revealing any evidence of leakage or other problems. Mechanical assesses utilized to determine test pressures will have a variety such that the greatest end of the scale is not higher than 5 times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will need an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be carried out utilizing a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not indicate the minimum pressure required for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as indicated by pressure evaluates throughout inspection will be deemed to show the presence of a leak.</p>
