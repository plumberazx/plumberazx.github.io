<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed due to the fact that of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
