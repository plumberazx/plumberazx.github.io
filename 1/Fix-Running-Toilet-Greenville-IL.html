<p>Difficult water, debris from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can avoid a flush valve from closing entirely. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the debris. Pictures 1 and 2 show you how to do this on one common kind of valve. Although other valves will look various, the clearing procedure is comparable. However, you may have to remove a couple of screws on top of the fill valve to eliminate the cap.</p>
