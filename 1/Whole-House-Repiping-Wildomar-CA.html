Typical water heater problems include cold or tepid water, a leaking tank or scalding water. The cause of these issues can be challenging to recognize, so it is essential to employ a professional plumbing contractor who is familiar with the knowledge required to locate the problem and make the appropriate repairs.</p>
<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 usually depending upon the length from the main gas line.
