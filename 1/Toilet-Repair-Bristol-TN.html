<p>Roto-Rooter was included in the SyFy television show Ghost Hunters (2004-2016) as the two founders of TAPS work for Roto-Rooter as plumbers in the company's Providence, Rhode Island branch. There are sections including Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson working as plumbing professionals in their day tasks at Roto-Rooter in between paranormal examinations on the program. Furthermore, a Roto-Rooter van is shown in the opening section of each episode. For some houses, water softening is only part of the solution. If you have iron, chlorine, or other pollutant concerns that affect the security and quality of your drinking water, a water conditioner or neutralizer may be the service.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the concern. You may need to check out using a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog. This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
