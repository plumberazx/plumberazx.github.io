<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance.

The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>

An RPBA is effective against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be used to separate health or non-health threats.</p>
