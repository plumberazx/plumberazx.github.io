He called several of his member contractors to find out what a fair and reasonable  rate would be for a garbage disposal install. Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally salt. The result is water that's been efficiently softened by eliminating almost all traces of the minerals that make up difficult water.</p>
