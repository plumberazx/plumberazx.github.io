The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a total damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to get away.
