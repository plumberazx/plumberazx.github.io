Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
