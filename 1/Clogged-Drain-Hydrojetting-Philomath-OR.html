<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (typically salt or often potassium).</p>
