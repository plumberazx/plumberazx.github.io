<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

This concern is frequently caused by a rusty pipe, flush valve assembly or as easy as a worn out flapper valve. A drip pan is affordable and reliable. The drip pan is set up under the water heater in order to collect any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into an ideal drain.
