<p>Camera are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
