<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has already been fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Once again, it is a good idea to inspect the maker's guidelines for special precautions.</p>

Backflow can happen in a variety of scenarios that may draw water from places such as garden fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. Backflow can likewise bring water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
