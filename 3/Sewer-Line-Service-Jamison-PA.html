If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety preventative measures you must take to protect yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.

Excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
