<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Inkster MI</h3>
<p>Salt-free systems will likewise lower scale buildup and provide brighter clothing and softer skin using a much healthier technique. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without having to add salt to the water. This is a more heart healthy and environmentally friendly system. Traditional salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have an unfavorable impact on people with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are beginning to ban salt-based softeners due to the high sodium content in the waste water. Salt-free systems are maintenance totally free and use no waste water, no salt and no electrical energy or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance since the media can last as much as 5 years without replacing. Salt-based systems need the salt to be renewed on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can position problems.</p>
