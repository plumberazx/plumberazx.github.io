<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Pataskala OH</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system must be constantly kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
