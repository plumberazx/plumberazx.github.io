<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
