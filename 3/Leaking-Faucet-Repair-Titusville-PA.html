Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will flow in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
