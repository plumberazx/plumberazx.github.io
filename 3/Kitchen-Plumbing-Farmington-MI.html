<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads end up being filled with salt ions from the water softener salt. As difficult water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Difficult water causes white or gray deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be utilized to lower these signs.</p>
