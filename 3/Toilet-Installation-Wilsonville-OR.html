<h3>Plumbing Services Around Wilsonville OR</h3>
<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure utilized to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any remaining contaminants.</p>
<p>The most effective method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
