<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was really promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
