<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two indications of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up with time, they slowly begin to restrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you observe it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, impacting your water quality.</p>

<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Hillside IL</h3>
<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
