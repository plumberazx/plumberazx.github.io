<p>Video cameras are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>All faucets and valves in your house should be frequently worked out to keep them from freezing in location.

Just like you and me, regular exercise keeps our bodies working at a greater level than if we sat doing nothing every day. Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air can visit your house, inspect the valves throughout your house, and recommend you of any alternatives or possible repairs that need to be considered now or in the near future.

When the zinc anode liquifies, this procedure ultimately stops. When this conditioner is exhausted, it will no longer impact your water, and you may not understand this has taken place until the hard water has triggered damage.
