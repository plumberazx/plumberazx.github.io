<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank renewed.</p>

<p>Those people in the market know that cross-connection programs in many areas have vastly reduced the variety of reported occurrences that occur within our water systems. This has at times resulted in individuals thinking that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there may never truly have been a concern in the first place. This thinking can be both hazardous and disadvantageous. Backflow occurrences in water systems are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a lowered pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing method to backflow protection. We need to take a look at each installation for the hazard it provides and after that install the proper defense.</p>
