<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
