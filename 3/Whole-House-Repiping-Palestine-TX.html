Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions.

The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>

Subsequently residential authorizations provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be tested each year. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an annually test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to operating the watering system.
