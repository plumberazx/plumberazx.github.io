Electric varieties are likewise easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less likely to lose heat.

Normally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires complete water shut off while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience minimal disturbance to your day-to-day routine.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
