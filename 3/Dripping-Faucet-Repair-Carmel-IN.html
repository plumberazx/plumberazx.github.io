<p>It is not always due to obstructions that stem inside the home when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root invasion. When tree roots start to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems.

While gas models are more economical to run, they do need an existing natural gas line. The cost of an electrical hot water heater is generally lower, but it can be more pricey to operate. Electric varieties are likewise easier to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less most likely to lose heat.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a danger to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
