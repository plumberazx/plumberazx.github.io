Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 indications of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate with time, they gradually start to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much accumulation to happen, so by the time you observe it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, affecting your water quality.</p>
