<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Eudora KS?</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
