<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
