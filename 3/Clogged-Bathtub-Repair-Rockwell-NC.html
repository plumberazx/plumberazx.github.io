Many water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank.

The tank flushes itself when certain levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank renewed.</p>

<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Rockwell NC!</h3>
<p>Search for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Because pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will stream in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
