If brand-new work is performed such as replacement of gas piping, a plan may be needed to get the authorization. Ultimately, you'll need to rely on a relied on plumber to encourage you whether it's time for a pipe replacement.

But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close.
