<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>

Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be correctly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
