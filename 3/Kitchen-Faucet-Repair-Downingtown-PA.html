<p>Lubrication might help with the positioning of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not assist the assembly work any better, it is only there to help the technician put together the parts into the body without producing damage from friction. The lube should be a food grade lubricant to guarantee the water system is not contaminated. Oftentimes the very best lube is water. The normal usage for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be gently lubricated to guarantee they do not roll out of their retainer. The use of too much lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to use or fail out sooner by drawing in dirt and particles or restricting the motion of the component. The appropriate amount of lubricant should make the surface of the 'ring appear damp. You must never ever see chunks or globs of lubricant.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has already been fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Once again, it is recommended to inspect the maker's guidelines for unique preventative measures.</p>

Many require big amounts of water and can be pricey for the electrical power expense, but the NuvoH2O system is various. Our saltless WATER conditioning system uses up to 4x less water than others and needs no electrical power.
