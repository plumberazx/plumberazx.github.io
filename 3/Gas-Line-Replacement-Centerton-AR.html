Constant feed waste disposal unit are the most typical, and the type most plumbers recommend. They're wired to an ON and OFF switch, found either under the sink or on a nearby wall.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the defective pipes changed.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
