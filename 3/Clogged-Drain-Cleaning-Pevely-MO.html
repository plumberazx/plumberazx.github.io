<p>An authorization and inspections are required for most residential tasks including patios, additions, and devices such as a/c and hot water heater.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to assist prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to break and solidify or simply be so squished that it does not fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure whatever remains in great shape.</p>
