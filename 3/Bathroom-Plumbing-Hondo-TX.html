<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Hondo TX</h3>
<p>Close all exterior windows and doors and turn on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a neighboring warm water faucet till you hear the gas burner in the hot water heater ignite. After a minute, move a smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Image 7) on top of the heater. The smoke should be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke doesn't draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Shut off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to remedy the issue.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can position problems.</p>
