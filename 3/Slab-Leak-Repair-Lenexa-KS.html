<h3>Prices For Unclogging And Video Inspection Lenexa KS</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
