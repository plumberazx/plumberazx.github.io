<p>Finally, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five individually running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best used in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
