<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario.
