I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
