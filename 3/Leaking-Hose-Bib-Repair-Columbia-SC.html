<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper.

This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a danger to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
