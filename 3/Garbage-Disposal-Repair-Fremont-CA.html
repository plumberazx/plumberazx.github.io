This has at times led to people thinking that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there might never really have been a concern in the very first place. This thinking can be both dangerous and disadvantageous. Backflow occurrences in water systems are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a minimized pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing technique to backflow defense. We need to look at each installation for the hazard it provides and after that install the proper protection.</p>
