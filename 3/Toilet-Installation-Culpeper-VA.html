<p>Leaking sewer lines inside your house can harm floorings, carpentry, and other valuable things such as cabinets.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that should also be well preserved to help avoid leaks and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to break and harden or just be so squished that it doesn't fill the space along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. We strongly recommend likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
