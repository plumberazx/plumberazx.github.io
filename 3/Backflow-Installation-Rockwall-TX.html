As soon as an individual ends up being a certified tester, there is a good chance the person understands how to test a backflow preventer.

<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task.
