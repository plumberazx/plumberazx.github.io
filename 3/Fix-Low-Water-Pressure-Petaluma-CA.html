These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately constant, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily stored for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
