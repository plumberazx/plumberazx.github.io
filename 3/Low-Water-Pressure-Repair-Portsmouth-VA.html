The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
