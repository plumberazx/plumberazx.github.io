<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Tallahassee FL?</h3>
<p>Drip Leg - Any dust or grit in the gas line falls into this short area of pipe before it can reach the water heater's control valve. The needed length of the drip leg differs. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and require less repairs over time. If you notice your water is taking too long to get hot, or you are lacking warm water extremely rapidly, it is time to call a professional plumber for a hot water heater inspection. The California Contractors State Licensing Board (CSLB) requires licensed plumbers to renew their license every 2 years.</p>
