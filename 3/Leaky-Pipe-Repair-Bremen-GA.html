<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads end up being loaded with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Difficult water triggers gray or white deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be used to minimize these signs.</p>
