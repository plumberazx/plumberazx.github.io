<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Exeter NH</h3>

<p>The most effective way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.
