<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it must put something back into the water. Many water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank.

The tank flushes itself when certain levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank replenished.</p>

One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it ought to be much less water.</p>
