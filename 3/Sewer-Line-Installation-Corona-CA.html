<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated up directly whenever it's needed. Tankless systems specifically make use of an aspect that warms up water when the tap is turned on. The water is continuously heated as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is immediately turned off, the water stops being heated. The heating temperature level is generally pre-set to suit your needs and choices. Because they just heat water when needed, tankless electrical water heaters utilize less power than conventional water heaters.</p>
