When water flow stops, pressure vacuum breakers use a check valve developed to close with the help of a spring. Its air-inlet valve opens when the internal pressure is one psi above air pressure, avoiding non-potable water from being siphoned back into the drinkable system. The assembly consists of resistant, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>

This, again, is due to the minerals present in the water you are utilizing to clean them with. With soft water, you don't have that problem due to the fact that it does not have the minerals that are in tough water.
