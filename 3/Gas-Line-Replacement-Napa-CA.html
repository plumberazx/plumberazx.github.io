When water flow stops, pressure vacuum breakers use a check valve developed to close with the help of a spring. Its air-inlet valve opens when the internal pressure is one psi above air pressure, avoiding non-potable water from being siphoned back into the drinkable system. The assembly consists of resistant, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>
