The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is usually localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on.
