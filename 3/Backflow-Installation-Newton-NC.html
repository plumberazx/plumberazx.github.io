<p>To assist prevent obstructions within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the method set out above. Because the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is especially real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
