Before salt starts working in a water softener it requires a little house time within the reservoir, because the salt is dissolving gradually. When one instantly begins regeneration after adding salt to the tank, the water softener may not work according to requirements. After an approval of plans has been issued and the assembly has actually been installed, it needs to be checked by a certified tester. The designer (or water provider) is then responsible to license that the installation was carried out in accordance with authorized plans; or describe any changes or send "As Developed" prepares as appropriate.</p>

<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to press the call a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange).

The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
