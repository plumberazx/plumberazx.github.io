An authorized, properly set up and preserved backflow assembly essentially eliminates the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric hot water heater have a shorter life expectancy than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capacity. Still, the distinction is insufficient to make any significant changes in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater might last 8-15 years, the electric option will last about 8-12 years.</p>
<p>In addition to the specific facilities noted above, an approved backflow prevention assembly must be installed on each safe and clean water service connection to any premises consisting of a prospective or actual hazard. Noted below are examples of hazards and the minimum protection needed to be set up for each kind of risk. The minimum accepted backflow prevention assembly for unlisted dangers will be figured out on a case-by-case basis by the Cross Connection Control Program.</p>
