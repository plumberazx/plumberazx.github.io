<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be tested yearly. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an annually test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated every year to insure the safety of the potable drinking water in your home.
