<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
