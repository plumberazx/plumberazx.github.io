<p>Unfortunately, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it frequently ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, especially in locations where water sits for extended periods of time.

The majority of residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More expensive gas hot water heater with special venting systems likewise are readily available. However they're harder to install, and we will not deal with them here.</p>
