Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>We use specialized diagnostic techniques and modern tools to ensure that your kitchen and bathrooms sinks, tubs and showers, toilets, floor drains, and main sewer lines are all in top condition. Many times you may hear that your toilet has actually continued to run after it's been flushed. This can trigger the water to spill down the into the overflow tube. This problem might occur by a pipe with obstruction or a malfunction with your flush valve. This can likewise be remedied by replacing your flapper valve.</p>
