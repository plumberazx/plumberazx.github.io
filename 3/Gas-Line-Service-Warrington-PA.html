The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide need to be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
