<p>Check out the water heater repair and installation services we provide. Our objective at Brennan Heating & Air Conditioning is to ensure that our Bellevue consumers have reliable warm water whenever they need it. The CareSoft ® system was established with the same advanced engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that delivers high-performance solidity removal you can depend on for several years to come. It's quite typical for debris to wind up being flushed down our drains. Consider how typically food particles, cooking oil and hair winds up in our sinks and showers. After enough time, these items might build up into blockages, which can block the flow of water throughout a home. This can result in a number of problems, from nasty odors to water leaks and burst pipes.</p>
<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this brine travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This process continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about completely regenerated.</p>
