<p>The Plumbing Division of the Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department is responsible for making sure that plumbing systems and competent trade individuals remain in compliance with code and ordinance requirements. The Plumbing Department evaluates strategies and inspects: brand-new building, changes and restorations of plumbing systems. This department is also responsible for providing plumbing permits, and signing up licenses for plumbing contractors and water treatment operators.</p>
<p>At AttaBoy Plumbing our company believe house owners deserve the best. That suggests the best in friendly, reliable, and affordable services. It also indicates the best parts and products, in addition to the highest level of fulfillment we can muster. The consumer has 30 days to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notification of Requirements form). Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be needed to be found on the water service line, within the building, or both locations. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a recently set up backflow preventer, the water customer is needed to have the backflow preventer evaluated on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>The function of the Information Inspection (license) is to have the plumbing contractor consult with an inspector at the task site to examine a proposed installation, which might not remain in conformance with the code. The proposal to deviate from the code is submitted in duplicate, in writing or with understandable illustrations, and states the reason for variance. The proposition may be thought about and authorized, if it meets the intent of the plumbing code.</p>
