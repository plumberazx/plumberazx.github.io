<p>You'll need an unique garbage disposal if you home uses a septic tank and drain field. The system must grind the waste even finer to prevent blockages and allow the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. As soon as, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, however should then transition to galvanized. I am unsure why that must be. It is also permitted to utilize black iron if it is probably covered with a galvanized finish (which is essentially a special paint"). PG&E often does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
