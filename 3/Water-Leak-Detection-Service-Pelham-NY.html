After a minute, move a cigarette smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Image 7) on top of the heater. The smoke should be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke doesn't draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Switch off the gas to the hot water heater and call a licensed plumber to remedy the problem.</p>
