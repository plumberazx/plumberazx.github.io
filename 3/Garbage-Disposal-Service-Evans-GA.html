<p>The typical service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced: whole-house repiping. If you live in an older home (constructed pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing, this is a choice to consider. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel eventually experiences corrosion and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
