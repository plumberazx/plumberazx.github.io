<h3>Clogged Sink in Palmetto Florida</h2>
<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
