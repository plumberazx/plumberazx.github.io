<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made from copper.

The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
