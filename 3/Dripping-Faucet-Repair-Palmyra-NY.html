<p>Salt-free systems will also reduce scale buildup and offer brighter clothes and softer skin using a much healthier method. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the capability to soften water without having to include salt to the water. This is a more heart healthy and environmentally friendly system. Conventional salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have a negative effect on individuals with high-blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high sodium content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and utilize no drainage, no electrical energy and no salt or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are exceptionally low maintenance because the media can last as much as 5 years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be renewed on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a process called ion exchange to remove difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical procedure referred to as Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that will not stick to any surface area in your home, keeping your appliances and warm water heaters devoid of tough water scale develop. Salt-free softeners are likewise referred to as water conditioners due to the fact that they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And due to the fact that these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate recorded ions.</p>
