<p>Salt-free systems will also minimize scale buildup and supply brighter clothing and softer skin using a much healthier approach. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without having to include salt to the water. This is a more heart ecologically friendly and healthy system. Standard salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative effect on people with high-blood pressure and heart problem. Some cities are beginning to ban salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and use no waste water, no electricity and no salt or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance since the media can last up to five years without replacing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be replenished on a regular monthly basis.</p>

<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be eliminated by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Again, it is suggested to check the maker's directions for unique safety measures.</p>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection.

Assemblies not currently listed must have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
