<p>When the data collected from the field test indicates the assembly has degraded in its efficiency listed below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers must just be repaired. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if necessary, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
