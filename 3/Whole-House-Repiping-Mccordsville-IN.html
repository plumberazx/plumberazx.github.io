<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Mccordsville IN</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system must be continually kept an eye on.

This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
