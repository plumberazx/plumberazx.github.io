Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
