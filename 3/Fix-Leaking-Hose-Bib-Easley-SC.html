<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily kept for later use when need rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
