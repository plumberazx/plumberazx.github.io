<h3>Water Heater Leaking in Franklin WI? How to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>

For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these occasions.</p>
