The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
