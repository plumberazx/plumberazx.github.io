<p>Backflow preventers should just be fixed when the data collected from the field test shows the assembly has degraded in its efficiency listed below the established minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
