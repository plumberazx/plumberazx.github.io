<p>A couple of local authorities need that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't use a PVB unless the water source is at the luxury of the irrigated area. It might not be installed in any place where it might ever be immersed under water. Some towns do not allow the usage of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some don't enable the use of a PVB at all, so consult your water service provider.

Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content.

Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
