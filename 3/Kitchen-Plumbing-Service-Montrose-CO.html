If your unit is outlet-ready-- take notice of this part-- make certain your disposal switch is in the off" position prior to you plug the new system in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pushed against it will lead to decapitation, it may scare a couple of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience. When to repair: Under no circumstances must your toilet move when you press or sit on it. If your toilet relocations, get in touch with a plumber The toilet may not have been set up correctly, in which case the plumber may need to tighten its bolts or replace the wax seal around its base.
