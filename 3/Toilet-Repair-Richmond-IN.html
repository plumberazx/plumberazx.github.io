The disposer unit is heavy and can be uncomfortable to navigate below the sink. Use a large bowl or other tough challenge prop up the system as you place it. Water softeners typically have a life-span of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are properly preserved. Making sure the salt water tank never lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Safeguarding the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also safeguard the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners improve the regrowth cycle and help eliminate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>

<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
