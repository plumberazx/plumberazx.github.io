<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is heated, tough water causes white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to minimize these symptoms.</p>

Most residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it.
