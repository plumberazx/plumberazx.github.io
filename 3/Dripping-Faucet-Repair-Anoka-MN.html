<p>Sediment Build-Up: If you observe weird popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your unit, this might be an indicator that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating component. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, because the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
