<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Lexington MA</h3>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
<p>If you choose to attempt this job yourself, be prepared to keep careful track of about a dozen tiny parts (put the stopper in the sink so none fall down the drain). There are several faucet styles, so you might not be able to tell what to replace up until you have actually done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or hire a plumber, this would be a good time to think of whether you wish to upgrade the faucet with a brand-new style.</p>
