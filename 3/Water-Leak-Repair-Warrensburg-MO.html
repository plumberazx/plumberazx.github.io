<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Warrensburg MO</h3>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can position problems.</p>
