<p>Although the professional concurred that the customer did the ideal thing in her efforts to tighten up the pipes, the professional saw that the pipe had ended up being incredibly worn away over the years and that a PVC pipe might be better matched for the customer's needs. He turned off the supply of water to the home, got rid of the corroded system and fit a PVC pipe in its location. Prior to leaving the home, the specialist brought back water flow and tested the pipe.</p>
