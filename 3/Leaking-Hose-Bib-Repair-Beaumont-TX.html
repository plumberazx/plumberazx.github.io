<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high danger" establishments.</p>
