<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off.

The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it ought to be much less water.</p>

<p>A water heater installation is not the repair on which to refine your plumbing abilities if you're reasonably inexperienced. So save yourself some serious difficulty by being honest with yourself about where your experience level is. The majority of backflow preventers are developed to allow the components to be eliminated for repair while the main body stays installed in the piping system.
