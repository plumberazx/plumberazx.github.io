<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it challenging to get to in-wall pipes, consider at least changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big job, replacing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, energy, or basement  room is fairly straightforward, since the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets ought to absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet ought to be replaced. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas beverages. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a threat to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
