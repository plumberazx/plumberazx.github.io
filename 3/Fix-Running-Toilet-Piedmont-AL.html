<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Toilet effectiveness- The higher the efficiency of the toilet, the more it costs. The performance of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more effective your toilet is. Discover if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were built prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how helpful, is an environmental toxin (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not want to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
