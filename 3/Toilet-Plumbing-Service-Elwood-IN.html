<p>Leaks are sneaky. While the time needed will differ based on the house size and the variety of discovered malfunctions, it's best to set aside up to 2 hours when you schedule an inspection.

If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next visit, they likely rushed the task (unless you have a very little plumbing system). When you call to schedule your appointment, ask the length of time the inspection normally takes.</p>

Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
