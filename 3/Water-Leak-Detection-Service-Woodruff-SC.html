<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at Woodruff SC</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
