<p>Installation and replacement costs are frequently comparable, though replacement typically will not need service charges, such as application charges. New meters must fulfill guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas providers may need a special meter for their services, restricting your choices. Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the office number listed on the building authorization. Inspections should be made after foundation excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to concealing work), and upon completion. NOTE: If defective work is found, the inspector will provide an offense notice, and a specific period of time is allocated to fix the problem.</p>
