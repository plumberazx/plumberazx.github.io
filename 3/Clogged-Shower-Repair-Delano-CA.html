<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high threat" establishments.</p>
