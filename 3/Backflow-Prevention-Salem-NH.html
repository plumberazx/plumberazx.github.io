Well, very first let's ask you a different concern: How old is your home? If it was built before 1970, it may have pipes made from an outdated product that will start to give you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they have not already).

At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
