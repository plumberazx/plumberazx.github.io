As rust and minerals develop gradually, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure.

A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
