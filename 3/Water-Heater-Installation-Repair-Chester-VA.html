Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
