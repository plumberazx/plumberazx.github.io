<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that ought to also be well preserved to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to crack and solidify or merely be so crushed that it does not fill the space along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
