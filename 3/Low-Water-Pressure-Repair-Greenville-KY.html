<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
