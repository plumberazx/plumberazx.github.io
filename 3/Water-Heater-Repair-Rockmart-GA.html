The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
<p>If you are in a position that you discover the indications of a gas line leak, the most essential thing to do is to get out of your home as quickly as possible.
