<p>Backflow prevention devices are designed to secure the public water supply from cross-connections. A modern-day neighborhood water supply system is developed to guarantee that water streams to properties and structures under pressure. This neighborhood water network includes lots of users where there is a danger to public health if there is a cross-connection between the supply of water and a contaminated source. A cross-connection can occur where there is a pressure drop in the water pipe. This pressure drop triggers a vacuum and siphons of entrainment water from end-users into the general public water system.</p>

Conventional tank water heaters: These water heaters are generally powered by gas or electrical power. They hold 20 to 100 gallons of water, depending upon the needs of your household. Incorrect maintenance such as failure to replace filters or media at the appropriate time will be judged as "overlook". So also, the installation of any system on water conditions beyond the advised spec for that particular system will render the service warranty void and non-binding.</p>
