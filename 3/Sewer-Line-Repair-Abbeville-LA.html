<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Abbeville LA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Many property owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their unclean or clogged drain issues. These chemicals are easy to use and low-cost, however they damage your pipes and their impacts are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use harsh chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe producing weak points that are susceptible to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly recommended.</p>
