They then insert a new replacement pipe on one end and pull it through the old pipe's course using a hydraulic machine. This causes the old pipe to burst or split in order to replace it with a new, stronger, leak-resistant and extremely durable sewer pipe without having to collect the old one first.</p>

<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on lorry traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a total damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to escape. Often no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down results in a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
