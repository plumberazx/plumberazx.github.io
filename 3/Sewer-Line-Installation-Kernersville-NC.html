<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement.

Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to leave.
