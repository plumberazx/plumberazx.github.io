<p>Lots of toilet problems, including leaking toilets, do not demand repairing the whole toilet. Like any house appliance, a toilet tank includes numerous small moving parts that may need changed with use over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and trigger toilet leaks that aren't plainly visible to the naked eye.

Momentary water will be enabled after the contractor installs a hose bibb assembly consisting of a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker must be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker need to be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser needs to be strongly connected to sturdy rebar or wood stake to add structural stability to the assembly.
