Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water hardness can be gotten rid of fairly easily by using an ion exchange treatment. Standard water softeners are cation exchange devices.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well kept to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to crack and harden or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the area along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything remains in great shape.</p>
