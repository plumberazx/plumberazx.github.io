A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that can traveling through the sewage pipes without impeding water flow.

The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
