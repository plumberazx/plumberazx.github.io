Well, very first let's ask you a different question: How old is your house? If it was developed prior to 1970, it might have pipes made from an out-of-date product that will start to give you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't currently). And if your home was developed before World War II, then it likely requires replacements for its old pipes, probably whole-house repiping.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the problem if this is the case. You may have to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.</p>
