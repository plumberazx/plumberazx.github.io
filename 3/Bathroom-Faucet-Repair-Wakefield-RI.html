<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5). If your valve is a different design from the one we show, inspect the instructions. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
