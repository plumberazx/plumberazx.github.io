The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to get away.
