<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home (constructed pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two telltale signs of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up in time, they gradually start to restrict the circulation of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you notice it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, affecting your water quality.</p>
