<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Your pipes are a major element of your plumbing system, responsible for moving water all throughout your house. Gradually, though, your plumbing pipes can wear, causing leaks and clogs. This is especially true in older homes, where old, steel piping has actually not yet been changed with more resilient copper or plastic piping. Repiping is the job of changing an old our faulty length of pipe in your house with a new one. In some cases, whole-house repiping might be needed to replace all the pipes in your house.</p>
<p>The normal option is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced: whole-house repiping. If you live in an older house (built pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing, this is a choice to consider. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually experiences rust and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
