<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are available if the resin has actually already been fouled. Once again, it is suggested to check the manufacturer's guidelines for unique precautions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically ends up being destructive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in areas where water sits for extended periods of time.
