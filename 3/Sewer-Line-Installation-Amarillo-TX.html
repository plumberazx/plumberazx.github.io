<p>A leaking toilet is another typical issue house owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than most likely means your toilet has a leak. This problem is frequently caused by a rusty pipe, flush valve assembly or as simple as a worn out flapper valve. A drip pan is efficient and economical. The drip pan is set up under the hot water heater in order to gather any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into an ideal drain. An ideal time to install a drip or replace pan is when the hot water heater is being replaced.</p>
