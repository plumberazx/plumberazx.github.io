<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains significant amounts of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a problem-- for its numerous desired uses around your home.</p>
<p>Do you need a replacement for an older unit that's ended up being troublesome, or simply for a make over? How about for a structure addition or major remodel? Once once again, that's something you could do yourself, although it's typically much better to hire an experienced sink plumber in the San Diego area. Installation involves over a dozen actions, and getting rid of the old one involves even more operations. It can be tough matching up cut outs and component holes, and getting the new installation flat and level with whatever sealed up.</p>
<p>Any sewer-related checks will require a camera inspection. For a sewer camera inspection, a camera can be put down the drain in a sink to examine the pipes in your house, or an outdoor pipe to examine the sewer main in the yard. Sewer cams can go hundreds of feet into the pipe, so they can be used to scope the main line. The camera will send out a signal when it finds the clog, telling the inspector the specific location.
