<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
