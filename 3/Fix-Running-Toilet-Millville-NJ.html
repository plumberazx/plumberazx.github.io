<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

Most residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas hot water heater with unique venting systems also are readily available. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
