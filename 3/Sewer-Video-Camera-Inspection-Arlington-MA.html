<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and after that return to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not.

Such models are convenient if you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule.</p>
