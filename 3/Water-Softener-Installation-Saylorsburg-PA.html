<p>106.2.3 Plumbing Maintenance. The clearing of interruptions in component branches; the fixing of incidental leaks in components, valves or pipes; or the elimination and reinstallation of existing or brand-new plumbing fixtures, residential type plumbing appliances, non-testable backflow gadgets, and plumbing appurtenances; supplied that such repairs do not include or need the replacement of hidden piping, or the rearrangement of valves, pipes or fixtures. Plumbers are the people to call when you have sewer or water line problems.

The pipes can end up being fragile, in time, and may require replacement faster than hoped. Some states require pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they may also need a special license to deal with gas lines. Licensing normally needs a test or work experience or both.

After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its brand-new area and placed there.
