<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
