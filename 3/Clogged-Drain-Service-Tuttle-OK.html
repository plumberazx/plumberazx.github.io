<p>Instead, call among our professional plumbers to come and repair your drain for you. Our Greenville drain cleaning professionals will offer you with the service you need to rapidly get your plumbing back in working order. We have cutting edge devices to properly determine what plumbing option will be needed, including drain cams, snakes, and rooters. Often a plumbing problem is more than simply a leaky faucet - often it's a pipe problem. Call one of our sink repair experts if you have actually discovered your pipes making loud or odd noises (one of the most common is a hammering sound). We'll take a look at the situation and if we find that your pipes are old, we may suggest a replacement. If we find that it's just a leak or a fitting problem, we'll repair it as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
