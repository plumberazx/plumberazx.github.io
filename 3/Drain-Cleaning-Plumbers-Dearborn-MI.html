<p>Backflow is bad news. Clamp the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted salt water option after the regrowth cycle.

<p>This ion exchange process is assisted in by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with salt ions. This is another combination that can deal with sink blockages. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mixture sit for numerous hours, then flush with boiling water. You can duplicate this process if it does not work the very first time. We do warm water heaters setups and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
<p>If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has actually likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As a result, we advise changing your unit if it is over ten years old. Under no situations must you ever try to fix gas leakages yourself. Contact a membe rof our gas pipe installer group to receive help with a gas line installation, repair, or replacement task in the Chicago suburbs. We provide gas line replacement choices in areas such as Clarendon Hills, Darien, Lisle, Plainfield, Wheaton, Westmont, and Naperville, Illinois.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most house centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
