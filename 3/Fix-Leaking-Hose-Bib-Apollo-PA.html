<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high danger" facilities.</p>
