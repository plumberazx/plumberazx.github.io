<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Livingston TN</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>

However keep in mind, you can't link the flare fitting on the flexible gas line supply directly to a steel pipe thread. You need to install the flare fitting that's included with the package.</p>
