When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals.
