<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
