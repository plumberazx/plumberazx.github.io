<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
