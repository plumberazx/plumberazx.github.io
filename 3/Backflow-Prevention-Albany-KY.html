From plumbing repair to heating replacement to A/C maintenance, we're your one-stop resource. While combating a fire, firefighters are naturally more worried about drawing adequate water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not just will they use water from any available source to achieve their objective, but fire department lorries typically bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>A clogged pipe can also permit water to leak into a foundation. This not just deteriorates the structural integrity of a building, but it can also let water in through the floorboards, causing them to deteriorate and stain in time. If a clogged pipe is left ignored for too long, it could result in flooding and stagnant water, which draws in and breeds mildew, mold, and undesirable bugs-- all of which are serious health threats.
