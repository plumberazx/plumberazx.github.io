<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system.

<p>If you home uses a septic system and drain field, you'll need a special garbage disposal. The unit must grind the waste even finer to prevent obstructions and allow the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. When, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but needs to then shift to galvanized. I am not exactly sure why that should be. It is also enabled to utilize black iron if it is probably coated with a galvanized covering (which is generally an unique paint"). PG&E often does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
