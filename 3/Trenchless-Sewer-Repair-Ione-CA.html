<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>

Backflow Preventer definition: A device that enables water to go through it in one instructions, however prevents it from going backwards in the opposite instructions.</p>
