This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is necessary to overcome the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its design and absence of moving parts. Nevertheless, it may be not practical in numerous situations to install a pipe section of this length. Additionally, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
<p>Mechanical failure or sediment build-up in backflow preventers can trigger excessive pressure loss.
