A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring incantations to the drain gods.</p>
