<p>The term difficult water describes water with a high mineral content.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper.

The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
