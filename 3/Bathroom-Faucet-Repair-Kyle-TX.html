<p>When the information gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has broken down in its performance listed below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers need to just be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if necessary, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>

This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is just recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (normally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
