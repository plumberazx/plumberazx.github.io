<h3>Leaky Faucets in Griffin GA - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system needs to be continually monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
