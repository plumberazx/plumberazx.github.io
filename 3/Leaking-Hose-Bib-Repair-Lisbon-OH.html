<p>Your sewer line problem can result in sewer backups, and they usually happen in the lowest open drain. This kind of problem is usually the outcome of a blockage in the line.

Every drain in your home depends on the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, nevertheless, just one drain has backup problems, there's a separated problem with just that drain, which is not most likely to be a sewage issue.</p>
