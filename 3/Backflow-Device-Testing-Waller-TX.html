In truth, you should seldom have a clogged toilet if you are using it effectively and if it is operating properly.

<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine goes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are consequently sent to drain. This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
