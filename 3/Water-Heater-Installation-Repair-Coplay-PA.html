<p>A reduction in supply side pressure caused by an occurrence such as a water main break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire combating, causes the supply pressure to drop listed below the consumer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve enables the excess client side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release until the supply side pressure again exceeds the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a lot of quality kitchen sinks to pick from.
