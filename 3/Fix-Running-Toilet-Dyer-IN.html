<p>Try to find a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage.
