<p>First turn off the power to the hot water heater at your main electrical panel. Then follow the same draining procedures as for a gas hot water heater. Whole-house water softeners come in a range of sizes and styles to accommodate the size of your home and household.

<p>A brand-new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the within worn thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin spots leak right now and sometimes those leakages come days or weeks later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be correctly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
