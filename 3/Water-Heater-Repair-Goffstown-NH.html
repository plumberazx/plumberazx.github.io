Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
