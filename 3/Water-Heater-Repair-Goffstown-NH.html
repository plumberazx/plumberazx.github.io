I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
