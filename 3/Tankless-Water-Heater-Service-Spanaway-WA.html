<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads end up being filled with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. Hard water triggers gray or white deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these symptoms.</p>
