Garbage disposal service warranties last approximately 5 years, however they can vary between 2 and ten years. Considering that the average life-span of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you may want to buy a prolonged service warranty. Most guarantees cover the cost to repair and replace regular wear and tear failures. To avoid additional breakdowns, homeowners ought to keep up with routine maintenance of their garbage disposal.</p>
<p>She understood about the service call cost. The 4 In Your Corner Investigation found that's a common fee.

None of the businesses we called would provide an estimate over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the situation prior to devoting to a cost, and all wished to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
