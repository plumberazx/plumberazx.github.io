A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
