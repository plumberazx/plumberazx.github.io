<p>The rust inside the pipe can break off and be carried out through the taps. This will cause your water to look brown or rusty, and the water might have a bad or nasty odor to it. When the piping in your house starts to reveal any of these signs of deterioration, you will inevitably need to repipe the whole plumbing system. The reason a toilet won't flush could be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain below the toilet can also be the cause. Hiring a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your initial step; a plumber can diagnose the concern and repair it.</p>
