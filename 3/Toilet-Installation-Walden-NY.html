Backflow is a problem because it can trigger wastewater to recede into a house, contaminating the drinking water. Cover the flapper valve with your hand. Switch on the water (carefully, so you don't get a cold shower!) and let it eliminate the toilet valve for a few seconds.</p>

Although colorless, decreased iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has already been fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Again, it is suggested to inspect the manufacturer's directions for special precautions.</p>
