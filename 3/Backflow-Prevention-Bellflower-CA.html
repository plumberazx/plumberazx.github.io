<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water passes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>

<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Bellflower CA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>The most effective way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
