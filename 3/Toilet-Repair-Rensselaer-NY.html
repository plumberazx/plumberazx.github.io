Secure the drain hose securely and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning drainage, all drain hose pipes must have an air space. The end of the hose be at least two inches above the dedicated drain. An air space might be used to achieve this, and may be needed depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>
