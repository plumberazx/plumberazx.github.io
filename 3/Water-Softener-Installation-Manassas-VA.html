<p>Try to find a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines.</p>
