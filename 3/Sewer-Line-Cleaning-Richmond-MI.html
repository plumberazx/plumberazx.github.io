<p>As soon as the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut down remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>

Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything remains in great shape.</p>
