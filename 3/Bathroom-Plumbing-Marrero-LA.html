<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The simplest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is needed to overcome the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simplicity of its style and absence of moving parts. Nevertheless, it may be not practical in many scenarios to install a pipe section of this length. Additionally, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
