<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 typically depending on the length from the main gas line. Setting up a gas line for a grill costs $99 to $600, while a fire pit that's out in the backyard costs $300 to $1,400.

More recent systems use electronic sensing units that keep an eye on bead exhaustion and other key metrics based upon your water use and for that reason just regenerate when needed. These newer systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
