<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing set up during building of a new or refurbished structure is set up by knowledgeable craftsmen in accordance with applicable codes. used to separate the tree roots and repair your sewer pipe from within, removing the need to dig up a big part of your backyard to access the pipe. Most trenchless repairs can be made within one to two days and just cause minimal-- if any-- changes to your yard. After your pipe has been cleared and repaired, routine maintenance can help to prevent any future obstructions. Speak to your Portland plumber about routine maintenance, inspections, and drain cleaning to safeguard your brand-new sewer pipe.</p>
<p>Pipe Relining - This is a cost-efficient solution to fixing pipes.
