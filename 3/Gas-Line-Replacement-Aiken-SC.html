The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
