<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high danger" establishments.</p>
