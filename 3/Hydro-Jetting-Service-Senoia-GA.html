<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be eliminated by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has currently been fouled. Again, it is suggested to check the producer's instructions for unique safety measures.</p>
<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water created in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This procedure continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered totally restored.</p>
