With a water heater replacement, you'll resolve your repair concerns, and have actually enhanced hot water heater performance as well. The sodium uptake through softened water depends upon the hardness of the water. Averagely, less than 3% sodium uptake comes from consuming softened water. Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the firmness ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide need to be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
