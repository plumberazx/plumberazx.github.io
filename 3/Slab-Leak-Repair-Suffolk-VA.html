<p>Your Local Plumbing, Heating & Cooling Specialists Since 1938. You'll observe the difference the very first time you shower or bathe with softened water. Soft water feels noticeably smooth to the skin. It likewise makes your home easy to clean by reducing hard-water accumulation. High water pressure also harms plumbing. The water entering the home puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut off valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure causes leakages, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to occur without proper pressure decrease.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it must put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>

<p>An atmospheric pressure test is needed. The test pressure will be at least 1 1/2 times the working pressure, but no less than 3 pounds per square inch (psi). The test period will not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall stand up to the test pressure specified without showing any evidence of leak or other flaws. Mechanical assesses used to determine test pressures will have a variety such that the highest end of the scale is not higher than 5 times the test pressure. For example, a 3 psi test will need an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test could be performed using a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system shall be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not suggest the minimum pressure needed for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as indicated by pressure assesses throughout inspection shall be considered to indicate the existence of a leak.</p>
