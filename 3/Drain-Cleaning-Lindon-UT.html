A blocked drain can also trigger problems when flushing the toilet and lead to other drain concerns, like water leakages and rupturing pipes.</p>
<p>A new hot water heater will likely last longer, provide you less problems, and cost you less to operate gradually. Slow drains: If you see that your drains are clearing slower, it might be indicative of the early phases of a clog.
