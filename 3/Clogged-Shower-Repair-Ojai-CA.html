Since the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially true when the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high threat" establishments.</p>
