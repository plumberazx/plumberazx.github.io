Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day.

This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
