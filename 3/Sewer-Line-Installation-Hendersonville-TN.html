<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Hendersonville TN</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning team is happy to utilize Bio-Clean items for every drain-cleaning task. Bio-Clean is a natural service that's both safe to your plumbing and remarkably reliable at removing gunk, waste, and natural product that so frequently congests your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, rusting the sidewalls and only partly repairing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live germs that actively seek out natural product and gnaw at it, producing harmless byproducts of carbon water, mineral, and dioxide ash, all of which are quickly treated at local sewage plants.</p>
