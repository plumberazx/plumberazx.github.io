<p>Unseen sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain pathway, little pipes range from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a bigger one underneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the home. A great way to decrease the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a waste disposal unit.
