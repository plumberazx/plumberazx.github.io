<p>A freshly installed hot water heater must not produce weird sounds, but it will start to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat the water. Things intensify drastically for households with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. A hot water heater replacement might be essential if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed.</p>
