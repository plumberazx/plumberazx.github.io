<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads end up being loaded with salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Hard water causes white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these signs.</p>
