<p>It prevails for hot water heater to leak due to varying pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve becomes part of the system for that precise factor. But while small drips must not be cause for issue, homeowners should keep an eye on the water heater leakages.

Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water solidity can be eliminated relatively easily by using an ion exchange procedure. Basic water softeners are cation exchange devices.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
