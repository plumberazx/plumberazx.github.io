Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water solidity can be gotten rid of relatively quickly by using an ion exchange procedure. Basic water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations refer to positively charged ions dissolved in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the solidity ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>Difficult water, particles from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can avoid a flush valve from closing completely. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the debris. Pictures 1 and 2 reveal you how to do this on one typical type of valve.
