Turn off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.)

For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow in reverse into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these events.</p>

It will be much better to cope with a new, more effective system than to invest in frequent repairs.</p>
