<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>

It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational use, water pressure pushes the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really crucial here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect versus back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It likewise has to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
