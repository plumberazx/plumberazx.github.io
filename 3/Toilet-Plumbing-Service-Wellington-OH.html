<h3>Clogged Drain Services at Wellington OH</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains significant amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its numerous intended uses around your house.</p>
<p>Your sewer line issue can lead to sewer backups, and they typically occur in the lowest open drain. This type of problem is usually the outcome of a blockage in the line. If you do not identify the smell coming from the sewer backup, you may recognize this problem since a backup happens whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house depends on the main sewer line for correct drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated concern with only that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
<p>The term hard water" may seem like an oxymoron, but it's just household water that contains high concentrations of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. These minerals do not make water unhealthy to drink. They likewise are relatively undetectable through odor or taste, however they can be harmful simply the same. Just like our trenchless services, we will initially conduct pipe leak tests using video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
