<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The simplest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is essential to overcome the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its style and absence of moving parts. However, it may be unwise in many scenarios to install a pipe section of this length. Furthermore, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>

Contact your state's licensing board for additional information.</p>

Short-lived water will be allowed after the contractor installs a hose bibb assembly including a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker should be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker must be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser must be firmly connected to tough rebar or wood stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection between the water meter and the structure plumbing prior to the structure is significantly total is restricted unless a check backflow assembly is set up and right away evaluated to ensure it is working.</p>
