In some cases, a gas line might be covered if it is ruptured. This type of circumstance may occur if a contractor is dealing with an individual's landscaping and unintentionally burst a line.

If you haven't done so currently, we recommend setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to inform you of any prospective gas leaks.</p>
