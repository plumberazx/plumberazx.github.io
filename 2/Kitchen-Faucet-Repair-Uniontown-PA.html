<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
