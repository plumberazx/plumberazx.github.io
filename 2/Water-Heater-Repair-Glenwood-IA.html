<p>Your initial step is to shut off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5). If your valve is a various style from the one we show, examine the directions. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Typically, the savings have been based mainly on lowering chemical and cleaning agent costs.

<p>To decrease the need of gas line repair, it is very important to understand the common reasons for gas leaks. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning devices take place most commonly in the winter. This is due to the fact that homes are not adequately aerated during the cooler months to avoid heat loss. We advise setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to signal you of any potential gas leakages if you have not done so already.</p>
