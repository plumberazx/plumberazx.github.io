Plumbing codes mandate that drinkable water products be secured against backflow at all cross-connections. We provide the biggest selection of backflow prevention solutions for any application.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
