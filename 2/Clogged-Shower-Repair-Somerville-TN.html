<p>What is difficult water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many designated usages around your house.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become complete of salt ions from the water softener salt when freshly restored. As difficult water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. When water is heated up, hard water causes white or gray deposits. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these signs.</p>
