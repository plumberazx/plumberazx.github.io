<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular new sinks, however these will be labeled to that result. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>

<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
