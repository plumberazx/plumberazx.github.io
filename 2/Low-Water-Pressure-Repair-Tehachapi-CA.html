<p>There are a couple of types of hot water heater to pick from, each style has its disadvantages and advantages. The best one for you depends on how much hot water you use, and the heating approach (electrical energy, gas, oil).

CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) is one of the most common kinds of plastic piping used in plumbing systems today.
