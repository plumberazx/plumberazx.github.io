<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance might occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
