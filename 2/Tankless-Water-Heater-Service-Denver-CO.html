Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to escape.
