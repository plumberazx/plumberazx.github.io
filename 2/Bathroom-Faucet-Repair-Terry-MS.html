<p>Unless your bathroom renovation is purely cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing may effectively belong to your project requirements. Water enters the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has an unfavorable charge, which brings in the favorably charged minerals in the water (a procedure known as, ion exchange). The mineral deposits hold on to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and streams throughout your house. Tankless technology makes good sense. Once you understand the advantages, it's easy to see why house owners in Charlotte, North Carolina, select these products over conventional water tanks.
