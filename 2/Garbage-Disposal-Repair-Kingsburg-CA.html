Harts is an excellent local company to deal with. How will you handle an extreme clog after it blocks a chemical drain cleaner? Blocked cleaner can produce a toxic swimming pool in your sink, making any brand-new attempt to clear it more unsafe. You'll need to install that initially if your disposal's installation will need a new mounting flange in the sink. Remove it as talked about above if you're replacing an old disposer.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
