<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6).

When needed, newer units use computerized sensors that monitor bead deficiency and other essential metrics based on your water use and for that reason just restore. These newer systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal because they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
