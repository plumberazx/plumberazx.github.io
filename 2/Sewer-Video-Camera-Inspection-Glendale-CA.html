If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you should require to safeguard yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions also allow options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
