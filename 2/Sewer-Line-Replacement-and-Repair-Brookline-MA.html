<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can position problems.</p>
