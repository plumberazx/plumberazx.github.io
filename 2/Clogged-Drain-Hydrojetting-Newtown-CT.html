<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
