<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Windham NH</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
