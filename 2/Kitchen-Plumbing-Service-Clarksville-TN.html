<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the magnificence in the toilet world, however the journey lever is the bridge between male and machine. After all, if the journey lever does not lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to wiggle and jerk and sometimes even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper manually. And who wishes to do all that work??? In all severity though, making sure your journey lever is working well can save you the inconvenience of those small day-to-day inconveniences - that the majority of people simply live with and never recognize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water squandered every day by a poor seal.</p>

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas beverages. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe.

The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
