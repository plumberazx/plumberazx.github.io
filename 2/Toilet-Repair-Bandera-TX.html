<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Since water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily kept for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
