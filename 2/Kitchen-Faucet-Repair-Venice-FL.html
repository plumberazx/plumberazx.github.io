<p>For the purpose of water treatment, solidity is measured in either grains per gallon (gpg) or parts per million (ppm). Grains per gallon is defined as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) liquified in one United States gallon (3.785 l) of water. Parts per million is specified as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. To transform in between gpg and ppm utilize the following factor; 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm.

<p>If you identify a leak and select a patching job instead of a repiping job, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the same material and they may be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to consider repiping your entire house when you find a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
