<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
