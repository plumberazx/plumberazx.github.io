WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
