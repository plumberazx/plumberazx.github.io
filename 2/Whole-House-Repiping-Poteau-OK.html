I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
