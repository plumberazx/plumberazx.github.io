During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
