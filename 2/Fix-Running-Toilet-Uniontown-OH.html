Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
