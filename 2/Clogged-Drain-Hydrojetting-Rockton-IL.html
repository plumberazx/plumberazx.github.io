<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.

At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
