<p>Backflow is bad news. Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted brine service after the regeneration cycle. Clamp the drain hose securely and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning drainage, all drain pipes must have an air space. Completion of the hose be at least two inches above the devoted drain. An air gap might be utilized to accomplish this, and may be needed depending on local plumbing codes.</p>

<p>Does your shower switch from icy cold to unbearably hot on a cent?
