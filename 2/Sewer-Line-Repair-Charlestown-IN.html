<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it challenging to gain access to in-wall pipes, think about at least changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge job, changing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, energy, or basement  room is relatively uncomplicated, due to the fact that the plumber can quickly get at the pipes.
