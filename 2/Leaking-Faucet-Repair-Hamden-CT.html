<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

Before salt begins working in a water softener it needs a little home time within the tank, since the salt is liquifying gradually.
