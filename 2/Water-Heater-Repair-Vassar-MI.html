<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.
