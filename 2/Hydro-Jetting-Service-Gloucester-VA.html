<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is generally utilized in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
