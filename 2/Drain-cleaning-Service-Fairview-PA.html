<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily saved for later use when need rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
