<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units.
