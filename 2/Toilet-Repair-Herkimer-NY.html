The lubricant should be a food grade lube to guarantee the water supply is not polluted. In most cases the best lubricant is water. The normal usage for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings must be gently lubed to ensure they do not present of their retainer. The use of excessive lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to stop working or use out quicker by drawing in dirt and debris or restricting the movement of the element.

At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
