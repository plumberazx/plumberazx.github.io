<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>When picking an insured and licensed plumbing contractor is just a basic phone call away, why risk an insurance coverage claim on a flooded home. LM Construction and Mechanical is the hot water heater installation and replacement professional in Santa Fe, our team has installed and replaced countless water heaters throughout northern New Mexico. If your water heater is 15 years of ages or more, it might be time to get brand-new hot water heater installed if your guarantee has ended.
