<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>

Sluggish or clogged drains will in addition recommend more substantial problems that just a licensed plumber can pinpoint.
