<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly.
