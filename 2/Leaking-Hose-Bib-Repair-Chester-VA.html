<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Toilet effectiveness- The greater the efficiency of the toilet, the more it costs.

Toilets need to absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet ought to be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>
