<p>Capability. Capacity is vital in selecting the proper hot water heater for your home. A top factor in properly sizing your water heater is the FHR (first-hour rating) is the number of gallons of warm water that the hot water heater can supply in an hour when the tank is complete. If the water heater tank is too little, you will not have enough warm water to satisfy your needs. If it is over-sized, it will heat more water than you use which increases your energy usage and utility expenses. Call Thomas & Galbraith Heating, Cooling & Plumbing to discover what size fits your needs and to install the proper water heater in your house.</p>
