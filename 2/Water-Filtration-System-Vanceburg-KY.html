<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Vanceburg KY</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
<p>If your house is over 50 years old, it's an excellent bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and a maximum of $15,000. The wide disparity in price is because of the size of your house, the sort of pipe you're setting up, and extra repairs you find you need to make at any time you go behind walls.
