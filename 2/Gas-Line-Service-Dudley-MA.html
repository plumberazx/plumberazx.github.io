<p>The water quality improvement market has actually earnestly looked for to sort out the accurate details on water softener system effluent.

Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
