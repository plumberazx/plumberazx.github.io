We service pipelines throughout the state of Georgia, from Atlanta to Athens, Savannah to Augusta, Macon to Marietta, GA, and beyond. The images provide a sample of a backflow device situated behind the water meter.</p>
<p>Unless you have a wily two-year old who likes to throw toilet tissue down the toilet, you need to not have regular blocking concerns. In truth, you must rarely have a clogged toilet if you are utilizing it appropriately and if it is working properly. If you are having a toilet that blocks continuously and in need of toilet repair from Vegas Valley Plumbing on a regular basis, then it's most likely time for a new toilet. This may be an indication that your toilet has a faulty part or there is a different obstruction in your sewer lines. In either case, you need to call us for a house plumbing inspection immediately.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
