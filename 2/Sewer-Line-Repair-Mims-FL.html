Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Replacing a stopped working garbage disposer can seem challenging. There's the usual nervousness about electrical power and water, the unfamiliar sink connection and sufficient drain fittings to make leakages a real possibility. Then there are the inconveniences of window shopping and the suspicion that the job could run into real money.
