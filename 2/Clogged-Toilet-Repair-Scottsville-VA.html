<p>Climatic vacuum breaker. Although you might have numerous climatic vacuum breakers on your system, the water will only flow through among them on its way to the sprinklers or emitters.

<p>To minimize the need of gas line repair, it's important to understand the typical reasons for gas leakages. Indoor gas leakages from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning home appliances occur most commonly in the winter.

We suggest installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to notify you of any prospective gas leakages if you have not done so currently.</p>
