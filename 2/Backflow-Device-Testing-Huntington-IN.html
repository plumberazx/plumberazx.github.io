<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed since of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
