<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions.

For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is simply recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically sodium or often potassium).</p>
