<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big quantity of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that can taking a trip through the sewage pipes without impeding water circulation. By installing a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by saving the amount of trash that gets sent to land fills and other disposing locations. With a garbage disposal the trash is managed through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
<p>In addition to the specific centers noted above, an authorized backflow prevention assembly must be installed on each potable water service connection to any premises including a real or possible  threat. Noted listed below are examples of threats and the minimum security needed to be installed for each type of hazard. The minimum accepted backflow prevention assembly for unlisted threats will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Cross Connection Control Program.</p>
