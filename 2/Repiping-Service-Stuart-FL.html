<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regrowed, the beads become loaded with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As tough water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated up, tough water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to lower these symptoms.</p>
