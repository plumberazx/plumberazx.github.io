<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is warmed, hard water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these signs.</p>
