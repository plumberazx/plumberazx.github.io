But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more.
