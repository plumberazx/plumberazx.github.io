<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Toilet performance- The greater the efficiency of the toilet, the more it costs. The efficiency of your toilet is determined in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. Find out if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were built prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not want to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Pipe Relining - This is a cost-efficient service to fixing pipes. Instead of digging, replacing, and making a mess of your yard, pipe relining includes using a specialized resin to replace the harmed pipe. Our service technicians will place a resin-saturated felt tube, which permits the resin to harden and form a new, strong pipe within the harmed pipe.
