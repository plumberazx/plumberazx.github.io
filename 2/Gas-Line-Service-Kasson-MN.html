<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to help avoid leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and break or just be so squished that it doesn't fill the area as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so used that they spring a leak. We strongly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
