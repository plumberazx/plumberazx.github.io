<p>Leakages are tricky. While the time needed will vary based upon your house size and the number of found breakdowns, it's best to set aside approximately 2 hours when you set up an inspection. There's constantly the opportunity that your plumber's previous job will run long and postpone the beginning time.

Ask how long the inspection generally takes when you call to schedule your appointment.</p>

<p>Unless you have a clever two-year old who likes to throw bathroom tissue down the toilet, you should not have regular clogging issues. In reality, you ought to hardly ever have a clogged toilet if you are using it properly and if it is functioning properly. If you are having a toilet that blocks constantly and in need of toilet repair from Vegas Valley Plumbing regularly, then it's probably time for a new toilet.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many house centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
