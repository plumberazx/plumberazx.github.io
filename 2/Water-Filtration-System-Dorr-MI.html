<p>This is one of the very first and main questions that you should ask yourself when it concerns repiping and changing plumbing in your house. The age of your house is a critical component to understand whether you need to repipe your home. This is not only since your plumbing has aged with time, but likewise due to the fact that homes that were built prior to a specific time period are more likely to contain galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is out-of-date worldwide of plumbing and beyond due to its level of sensitivity to rust. If your home was built prior to the 1970s, we highly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping. Chances are that your house may need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can function at optimal rates if your home was constructed years prior to that.</p>
<p>At Big Blue Plumbing, we are specialists in high efficiency warm water heaters. The previous years has brought a host of brand-new, more varied alternatives for enhancing your hot water heater's energy efficiency and reducing your utility costs. Whereas hot water heaters used to come in either tank or tankless choices, there are now much more choices for improving water heating energy intake. Tankless Water Heaters - If you are tight on space, or if you are interested in reducing energy expenses when heating water for usage throughout your home, then you might wish to consider the installation of a tankless water heater. Such designs heat water on-demand, implying that you pay to heat only the water that you need, as you need it.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
