<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it tough to get to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big job, replacing exposed pipes in a energy, basement, or crawlspace  room is fairly straightforward, because the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets must absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
