<p>Installation and replacement costs are often equivalent, though replacement usually will not need service charges, such as application charges. New meters need to satisfy policies and code requirements for their placement, and gas service providers may require an unique meter for their services, limiting your options. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the office number noted on the structure permit. Inspections should be made after structure excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon conclusion. KEEP IN MIND: If malfunctioning work is discovered, the inspector will release a violation notification, and a specific time period is allotted to remedy the problem.</p>
