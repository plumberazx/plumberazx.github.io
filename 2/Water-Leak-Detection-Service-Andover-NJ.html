<p>As water heaters age, especially when they approach the years mark, you might begin to notice some concerns. Any kinds of odd noises generally recommend trouble. Popping noises, for instance, show that the water is boiling (which should never occur). Sediment accumulation or a defective thermostat represent common reasons for boiling water.

While this might work in the short-term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the same product as other pipes in your house, implying that trouble could be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you assurance and avoid larger leakages down the road.</p>
