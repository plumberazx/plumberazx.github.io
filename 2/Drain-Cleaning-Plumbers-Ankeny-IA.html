<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated yearly. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked each year to guarantee the safety of the potable drinking water in your house.
