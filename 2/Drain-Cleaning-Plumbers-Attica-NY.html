Call (866) 701-5306 to arrange an appointment. An atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not typically specified by water purveyors.  It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to lie a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
<p>Lastly, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
