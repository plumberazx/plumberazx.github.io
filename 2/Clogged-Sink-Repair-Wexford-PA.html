<p>Backflow prevention gadgets are developed to secure the general public water supply from cross-connections. A modern-day community supply of water system is designed to ensure that water flows to residential or commercial properties and buildings under pressure. This community water network includes numerous users where there is a threat to public health if there is a cross-connection in between the water system and a contaminated source.
