Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. Therefore, all backflow preventers need to be tested periodically to guarantee they are operating appropriately. A visual check of air gaps suffices, but mechanical backflow preventers have to be evaluated with properly calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
<p>Lubrication might assist with the positioning of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly.
