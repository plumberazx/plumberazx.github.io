<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>

More pricey gas hot water heater with special venting systems likewise are offered. However they're more difficult to install, and we will not handle them here.</p>
