The instant warm water heater, which is referred to as a tankless water heater or the point-of-use water heater, has actually changed the supply of warm water in houses and commercial areas.

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water. A lot of water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank replenished.</p>
