Our company believe that if you are going to invest in copper piping, do it when, do it right.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY task.
