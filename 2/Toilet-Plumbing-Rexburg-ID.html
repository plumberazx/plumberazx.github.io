<p>If you need to hardwire the unit, wait up until it's installed under the sink. Note: It's probably a good idea to shut off power at the breaker now, so as to avoid forgetting to shut it off later.

<p>The water heater is a crucial component of the plumbing system, and it ought to last for several years as long as you get the right maintenance and repairs to prevent any problems. When you are prepared for a plumbing inspection, please contact your Plumbing Inspector noted on your permit.

<p>Last but not least, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During basic water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
