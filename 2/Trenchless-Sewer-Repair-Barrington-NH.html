<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the potable supply of water and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An approved, properly set up and maintained backflow assembly essentially eliminates the threat of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a much shorter life-span than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capability. Still, the difference is insufficient to make any significant modifications in the savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater might last 8-15 years, the electric choice will last about 8-12 years.</p>
<p>Poorly installed gas lines cause gas leaks. Gas leaks are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy project.
