<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Stainless steel blades are generally preferred due to the fact that they're less susceptible to rust. Other great alternatives are overload defense, which turns off the motor if it starts to overheat; an auto-reverse feature to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the unclean dishes get ground up in the disposal. And if your house is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal particularly designed to be used with a septic tank. provides a summary 1 of garbage disposals and septic tanks.</p>
