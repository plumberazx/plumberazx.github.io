<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a danger to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
