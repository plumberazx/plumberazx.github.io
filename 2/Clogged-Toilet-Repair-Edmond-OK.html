<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite an annoyance-- for its numerous desired usages around your home.</p>
<p>This ion exchange procedure is helped with by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. This is another combination that can work on sink obstructions.

You can duplicate this procedure if it doesn't work the very first time.
