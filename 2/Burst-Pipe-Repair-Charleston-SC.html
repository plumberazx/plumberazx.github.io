<p>Search for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow in reverse into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost during these events.</p>
