<p>The next action for an ambitious plumbing contractor is to earn a contractor's license.

Considering that the typical lifespan of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you may want to acquire an extended service warranty. A lot of warranties cover the cost to repair and replace typical wear and tear failures. To prevent further breakdowns, property owners must stay up to date with regular maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>
