Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
