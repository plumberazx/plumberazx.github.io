Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and cause toilet leaks that aren't plainly visible to the naked eye.

<p>David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors. He called several of his member contractors to discover what a reasonable and sensible  price would be for a garbage disposal install. Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- generally sodium. The outcome is water that's been efficiently softened by getting rid of nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute tough water.</p>
