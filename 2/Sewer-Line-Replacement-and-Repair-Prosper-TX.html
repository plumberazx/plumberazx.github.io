<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems.
