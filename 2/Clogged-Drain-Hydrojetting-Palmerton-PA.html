<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Palmerton PA</h3>

A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the new heater. To guarantee that we are supplying premium work and client comfort, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and completely trained to safely carry out water heater replacements. In addition to conventional hot water heater, we likewise install tankless water heaters, and heat pump water heaters.</p>
