For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to crack and harden or merely be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space along with it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
