We've currently seen what these two terms share, so what's the distinction between them? When it pertains to the issue of tough water, a conventional water softener actually gets rid of calcium, silica and magnesium ions, leaving it with little quantities of what is known as short-lived firmness". The softener changes these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
