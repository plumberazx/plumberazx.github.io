<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Pitman NJ</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
