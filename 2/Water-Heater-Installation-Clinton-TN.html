<p>Installation and replacement costs are typically similar, though replacement usually will not need surcharges, such as application charges. New meters need to meet policies and code requirements for their positioning, and gas providers might require a special meter for their services, restricting your choices. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the office number listed on the building authorization. Inspections need to be made after structure excavation (before pouring concrete), after rough-in (prior to concealing work), and upon completion. NOTE: If defective work is found, the inspector will release an offense notification, and a specific amount of time is allocated to fix the issue.</p>

Paper permit applications are processed every Tuesday. Inspections continue throughout typical hours by calling your regional plumbing inspector.</p>
