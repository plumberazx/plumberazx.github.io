<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it must put something back into the water. Many water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank renewed.</p>

<p>Electrolysis: This approach utilizes what is essentially a battery. Metal electrodes are immersed in the water and release positive zinc ions, which likewise launch electrons that move through the wire to the cathode.
