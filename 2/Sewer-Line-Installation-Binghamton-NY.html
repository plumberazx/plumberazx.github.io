<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>

You ought to also avoid using any type of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal since these chemicals will only harm the appliance even more.</p>
