<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair expense may be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800).

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (normally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
