<p>Making sure plumbing equipment such as lawn sprinkler and fire pumps are separated to their own particular networks is crucial in order to maintain drinkable water security. Read our evaluations to see what people are saying about our water heater services. If your hot water heater has required several repairs over the last few years, it may be time to get it changed. A great rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the life expectancy of the typical water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your water heater.</p>
