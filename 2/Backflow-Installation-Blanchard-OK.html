Plus, our patented Directional Circulation Screen system helps make sure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also safeguard the resin bed, so we do not need to lose area on freeboard" which is the empty area in standard water softeners that allow a churning of resin throughout regeneration to launch sediment, hardness and dirt.</p>
