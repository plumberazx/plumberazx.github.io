<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your house. When the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>

<p>Conditioned or softened water is great for your household's health. Make gas connections with strong steel pipe (Image 8) or soft copper with flare fittings (Fig. A).
