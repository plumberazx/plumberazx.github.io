<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
