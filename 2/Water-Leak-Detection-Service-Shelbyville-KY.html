Cracks in the porcelain - A broken toilet is a possibly leaking toilet. It will certainly need to be replaced if the porcelain on your toilet is split.</p>

The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ).
