This is essential to support the plumbing system and ensure the structural integrity. Copper piping has actually been the requirement for many years and is usually considered as the leading form of repiping. We utilize Type L" copper, which is the premier grade of copper. We believe that if you are going to invest in copper piping, do it when, do it right.</p>
