<p>Decreasing or getting rid of water firmness is made with a tool referred to as a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange process happens. A softener is comprised of different components, each having their own special function. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel normally constructed out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with adversely charged ion exchange resin.

The most standard type has an electrical timer that flushes and recharges the system on a routine schedule.</p>
