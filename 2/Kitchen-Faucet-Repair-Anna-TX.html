<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to service? The timing of regrowth depends upon the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, no matter whether the water actually requires it. When required, more recent systems use computerized sensing units that keep an eye on bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water use and for that reason just regrow. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect since they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
