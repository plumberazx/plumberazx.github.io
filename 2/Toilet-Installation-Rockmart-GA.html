The salt or potassium chloride is a sacrificial media and must be replenished regularly to ensure sufficient softening form the device.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water.

This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank replenished.</p>
