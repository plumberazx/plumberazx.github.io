<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
