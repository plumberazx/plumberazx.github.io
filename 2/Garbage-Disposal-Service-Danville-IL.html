<p>During the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this salt water passes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent to drain. This procedure continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered totally restored.</p>
