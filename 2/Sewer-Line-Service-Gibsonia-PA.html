Fractures in the Porcelain: Fractures in the toilet bowl can result in bathroom flooding if not dealt with rapidly. Signs of distress in the porcelain consist of spider veins spreading throughout the bowl or base. It's a great idea to replace the system prior to it fails.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
