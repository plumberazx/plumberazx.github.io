<p>She learnt about the service call cost. The 4 In Your Corner Investigation discovered that's a common cost. Customer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to try to get an estimate from personal plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of business we called would offer an estimate over the phone. All of them wanted to look at the circumstance before dedicating to a price, and all wished to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
