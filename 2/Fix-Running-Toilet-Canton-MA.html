<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many house centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
