<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 indications of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up with time, they slowly begin to constrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly.
