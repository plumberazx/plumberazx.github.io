I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
