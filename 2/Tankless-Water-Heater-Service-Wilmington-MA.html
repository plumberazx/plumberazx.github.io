<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically becomes corrosive. Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in areas where water sits for long periods of time.

More expensive gas water heaters with special venting systems also are offered. However they're harder to install, and we will not handle them here.</p>
