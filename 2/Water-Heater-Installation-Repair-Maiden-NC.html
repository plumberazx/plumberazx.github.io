<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high threat" establishments.</p>
