<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Marietta GA</h3>
<p>Search for a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow in reverse into the city water lines since pressure is lost during these occasions.</p>
<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the instructions if your valve is a various design from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
