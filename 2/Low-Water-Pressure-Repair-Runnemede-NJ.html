Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue.

<p>Your sewer line issue can result in sewer backups, and they typically happen in the most affordable open drain. This kind of problem is generally the result of a clog in the line. If you don't identify the smell coming from the sewer backup, you may determine this issue because a backup happens whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house is dependent upon the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated issue with only that drain, which is not most likely to be a sewage issue.</p>
