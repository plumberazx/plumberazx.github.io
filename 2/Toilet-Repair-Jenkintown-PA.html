Like any house appliance, a toilet tank includes numerous small moving parts that may need changed with use in time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear out and trigger toilet leaks that aren't plainly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can also take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate in time, they slowly start to restrict the circulation of water, leading to low water pressure.
