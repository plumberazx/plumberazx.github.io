<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in provided pressure to the water circulation, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to escape. Sometimes no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down lead to a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
