<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly kept for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
