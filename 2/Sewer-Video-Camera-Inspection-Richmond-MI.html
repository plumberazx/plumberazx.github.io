<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a procedure called ion exchange to get rid of hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical procedure referred to as Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This procedure transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that won't stay with any surface area in your house, keeping your devices and hot water heaters free of hard water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also referred to as water conditioners since they do not really soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it.
