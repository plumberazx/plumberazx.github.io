This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank replenished.</p>

<p>Some makers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas.

While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

This is an excellent indication that your pipes might be rusting from the within and therefore, need to be changed.
