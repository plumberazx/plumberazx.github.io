<p>Your sewer line problem can result in sewer backups, and they generally take place in the most affordable open drain. This type of issue is usually the outcome of an obstruction in the line. If you do not spot the odor originating from the sewer backup, you might determine this issue since a backup takes place whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house is dependent upon the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated concern with only that drain, which is not most likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
