<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Since water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
