<p>What is difficult water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains considerable quantities of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its many desired uses around your house.</p>
<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 usually depending upon the length from the main gas line.
