<p>Finally, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
