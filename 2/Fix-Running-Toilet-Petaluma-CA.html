Older toilets might work just fine, but if your toilet is actually old (and obsoleted in style), you may wish to consider a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.

<p>Our recommendation: Typically you'll want to choose PEX pipes not just due to the fact that they are low-cost, however because they're reliable and simple to install. If you have questions about what type is pipe is right  for your house, seek advice from a plumber for more details. Attach the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the installing ring to the flange from underneath the sink. Make certain you snap the backup ring in location.
