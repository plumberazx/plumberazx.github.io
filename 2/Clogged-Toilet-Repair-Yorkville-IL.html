<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
