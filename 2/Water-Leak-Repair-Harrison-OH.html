The result resembles drinking water through a straw. Backsiphonage can happen when there is a stoppage of water supply due to neighboring firefighting, a break in a water pipe, etc This product is simple to discover at hardware stores and in hardware departments.

<p>When the data collected from the field test indicates the assembly has deteriorated in its performance below the developed minimum standard, backflow preventers should just be fixed. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if essential, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This indicates the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
