Most need for plumbers will stem from new building and construction and the need to repair and keep plumbing systems in existing houses and other structures.

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" facilities.</p>
<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and listed below the first check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. An RPBA works versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and might be used to isolate health or non-health hazards.</p>
