Numerous insurance companies will not cover a slow leak. Claims might be denied since the standard HO-3 house owners' policy particularly leaves out "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over an extended time period." Call your insurance coverage agent and confirm your protection. Double check with your representative to confirm that your understanding is correct once you have read through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered.</p>

Large restaurants, hotels, factories and kitchen areas that handle high volumes of waste will require a strong commercial garbage disposal.</p>
