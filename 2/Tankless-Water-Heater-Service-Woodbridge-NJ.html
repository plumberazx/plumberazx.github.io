Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, no matter whether the water actually needs it.

These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they save energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
