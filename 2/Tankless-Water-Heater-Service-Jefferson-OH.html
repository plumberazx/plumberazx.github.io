<p>Regrettably, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it often becomes corrosive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main reason for the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks. The majority of residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it.
