<p>Remember, it is essential that you do not put just anything down your waste disposal unit unit. While such units are durable devices, they are not blenders. Bones, starchy and fibrous foods, grease, and other inorganic debris can in fact do major damage to your system. Whether you have actually unintentionally damaged your waste disposal unit system, or it has merely suffered from wear and tear throughout the years, we can look after the required repairs. Our garbage disposal repair service technicians can identify any problem that may develop with your system, and we can help you choose in between repair and replacement. If you wish to remain ahead of repairs, regular maintenance is a great way to do so.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
