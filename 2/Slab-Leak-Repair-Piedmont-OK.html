<p>Providing quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing.

<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it difficult to get to in-wall pipes, think about at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge job, replacing exposed pipes in a energy, basement, or crawlspace  room is fairly simple, due to the fact that the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets should absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
