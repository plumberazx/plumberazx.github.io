Excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
