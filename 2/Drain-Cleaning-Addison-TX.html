Mechanical assesses utilized to determine test pressures shall have a range such that the greatest end of the scale is not greater than five times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will need a maximum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test could be performed utilizing a 50 pound gauge, however not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not suggest the minimum pressure required for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as shown by pressure assesses throughout inspection shall be considered to show the presence of a leak.</p>
