<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly stored for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
