<p>Backflow preventers need to just be fixed when the data gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has broken down in its efficiency listed below the developed minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
