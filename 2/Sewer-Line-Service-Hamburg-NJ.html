<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds.
