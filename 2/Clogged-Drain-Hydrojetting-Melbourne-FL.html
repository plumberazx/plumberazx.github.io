We highly suggest repiping your house throughout spring or summertime so you don't have to worry about freezing temperature levels during the repiping process if you live in a cold-weather environment. Generally, if the problem is restricted to one sink or shower, drain cleaning is most likely the best solution. When more than one drain is clogged or sluggish, it can indicate a bigger issue with your plumbing system. When water can not flow easily through the pipeline, they can create pressure and trigger your underground pipes to break and leak Because the pipes run under the slab of your house, it can be challenging to find.</p>

Our extensive water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our consumers is kept free from harmful pollutants. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to equipment containing a nonpotable substance, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination might take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating and cooling system, into the drinkable water system. This can occur through a procedure called backflow.</p>
