<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Wantagh NY</h3>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to employ a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair bill may be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater. To ensure that we are supplying premium work and consumer peace of mind, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to safely perform hot water heater replacements.
