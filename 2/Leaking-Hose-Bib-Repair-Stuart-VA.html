<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Stuart VA</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its numerous desired uses around your home.</p>
