<p>The typical cost for trenchless pipe repair is normally around $6,000-$ 12,000, while dig-and-replace repairs are generally between $4,000-$ 13,000 (the larger cost range accounting for manual digging, depth and pipe location).

The resulting soft water is more compatible with soap and extends the life time of some home appliances. Water softening is generally achieved using ion-exchange resins.
