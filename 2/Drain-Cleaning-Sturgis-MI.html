Apprentices typically receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, along with some technical instruction, each year. Technical instruction consists of safety, local plumbing codes and guidelines, and plan reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, used physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and companies. Most apprentices go into a program directly, however some start out as assistants or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
