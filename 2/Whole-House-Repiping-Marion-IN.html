<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water.

This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank replenished.</p>
