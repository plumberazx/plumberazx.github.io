<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the faulty pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced: whole-house repiping. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older house (developed pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel eventually suffers from deterioration and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

However if it occurs a 3rd time, you run the risk of having your insurance provider drop you.
