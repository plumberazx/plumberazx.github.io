<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it tough to get to in-wall pipes, think about at least changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big task, changing exposed pipes in a basement, utility, or crawlspace  room is fairly straightforward, since the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets should definitely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be replaced. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>

This piece of equipment is the center of controversy with numerous backflow authorities and ought to never be confused with Double Check Valves. Consult local authorities for needed installation, as most do not acknowledge these as backflow prevention devices.</p>
