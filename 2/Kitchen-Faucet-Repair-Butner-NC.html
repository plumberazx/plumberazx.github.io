<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Toilet performance- The higher the effectiveness of the toilet, the more it costs. The efficiency of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more effective your toilet is. If there are any lead pipes in the home, find out. Residences that were constructed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing.
