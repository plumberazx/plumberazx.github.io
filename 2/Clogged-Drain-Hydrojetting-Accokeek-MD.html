<p>Salt-free systems will likewise lower scale accumulation and supply brighter clothing and softer skin utilizing a much healthier technique. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the capability to soften water without having to add salt to the water. This is a more heart healthy and eco-friendly system. Traditional salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have a negative effect on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are beginning to ban salt-based softeners due to the high sodium material in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and utilize no waste water, no salt and no electrical energy or chemicals.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
