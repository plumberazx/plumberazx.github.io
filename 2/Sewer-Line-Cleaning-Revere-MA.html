<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately constant, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily stored for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
