Well, first let's ask you a various question: How old is your home? If it was built before 1970, it might have pipes made from an outdated material that will start to offer you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't already). And if your house was developed before World War II, then it almost certainly requires replacements for its old pipes, most likely whole-house repiping.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the issue if this is the case. You might need to check out utilizing a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.</p>
