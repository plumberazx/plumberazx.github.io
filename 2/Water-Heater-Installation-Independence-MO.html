<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Independence MO</h3>
<p>Search for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines.</p>
