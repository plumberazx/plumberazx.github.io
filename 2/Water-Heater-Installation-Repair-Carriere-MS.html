<p>Sodium consumption from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride may be proper if health or ecological reasons require restricting salt. With time, the beads become covered with minerals and need to be cleaned. This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has three cycles: rinse, backwash and recharge. The regeneration procedure can be arranged instantly with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
<p>This ion exchange procedure is helped with by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with salt ions. This is another mix that can deal with sink obstructions. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mixture sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water. You can repeat this process if it does not work the first time. We do warm water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
