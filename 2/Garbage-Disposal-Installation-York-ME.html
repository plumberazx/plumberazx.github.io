<h3>Plumbing Company Serving York ME</h3>
<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are caught and eliminated. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to eliminate any leftover contaminants.</p>
<p>The most effective method to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
