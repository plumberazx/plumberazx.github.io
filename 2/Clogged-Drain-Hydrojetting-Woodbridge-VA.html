Water solidity is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium.

Which's where the term solidity" came from ... it's tough to clean in.</p>
<p>Lastly, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in important locations where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
