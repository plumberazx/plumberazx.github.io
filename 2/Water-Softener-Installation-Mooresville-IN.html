<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be gotten rid of by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Again, it is a good idea to examine the producer's directions for special precautions.</p>
