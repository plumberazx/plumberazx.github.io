<p>The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd highest energy consuming area of a house, next to cooling and heating. The amount of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.
