Worms for irrigation systems: Locals discovered parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the atmospheric pressure breaker malfunctioned on a privately owned underground lawn sprinkler. During a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system drew some water from the sprinkler into the city water. The house owner found worms swimming in the bathtub while filling it to bathe his child.</p>
<p>A couple of local authorities require that the PVB be set up within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't use a PVB unless the water source is at the high-end of the irrigated area. It might not be set up in any area where it may ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not permit the usage of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some do not enable the use of a PVB at all, so check with your water company. A PVB backflow preventer might spit or spill water out from under the cap when backflow occurs, so it needs to be set up in a place where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
