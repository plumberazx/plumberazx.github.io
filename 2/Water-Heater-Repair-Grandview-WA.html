<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads end up being filled with salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Tough water causes gray or white deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be used to decrease these signs.</p>
<p>The type of pipe you selected to replace your old pipes affects just how much you'll pay. Costs to load and haul away old products, installation waste and associated debris.
