We have a model to match your every need and kitchen design.

The most typical gas utilized for residential houses is gas. Energy companies supply this gas to homes through an underground pipe system.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the ring up a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
