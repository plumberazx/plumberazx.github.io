<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system needs to be continuously kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
