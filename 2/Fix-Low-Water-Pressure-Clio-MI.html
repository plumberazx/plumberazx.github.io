If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next visit, they likely hurried the task (unless you have a really small plumbing system).

Well, first let's ask you a various question: How old is your home? If it was developed before 1970, it might have pipes made from an outdated material that will start to provide you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't already). And if your house was constructed before World War II, then it probably requires replacements for its old pipes, most likely whole-house repiping.</p>
