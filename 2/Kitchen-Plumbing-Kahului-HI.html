<p>When the information gathered from the field test shows the assembly has deteriorated in its efficiency below the established minimum basic, backflow preventers must just be repaired.

These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow.
