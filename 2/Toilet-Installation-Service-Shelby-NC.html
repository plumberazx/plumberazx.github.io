This is essential to support the plumbing system and guarantee the structural stability. Copper piping has actually been the standard for many years and is usually deemed the premier type of repiping. We utilize Type L" copper, which is the leading grade of copper. Our company believe that if you are going to buy copper piping, do it when, do it right.</p>

While water overuse is an issue for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration procedure. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
