<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>As hard water goes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with sodium ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, free" salt ions are launched into the water. Softer clothes without difficult minerals caught in the fabric. Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the dingy gray caused by difficult water. Please send our thanks to all included with testing, repairing, changing and servicing our softener. Appreciate the time and service you send our way. The replacement tank has fixed the issue we were having.</p>
