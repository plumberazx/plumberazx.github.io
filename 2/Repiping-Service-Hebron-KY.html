<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Hebron KY</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
