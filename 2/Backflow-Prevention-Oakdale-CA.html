<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems use UV light to ruin micro-organisms and provide purified water. The energy source needed to heat the water is cheaper. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water hardness can be removed fairly quickly by using an ion exchange treatment. Basic water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations describe positively charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the solidity ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>As difficult water goes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with salt ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this process, complimentary" salt ions are launched into the water. Softer clothing without difficult minerals trapped in the material. Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the dull gray caused by tough water. Please send our thanks to all involved with testing, repairing, replacing and servicing our softener.
