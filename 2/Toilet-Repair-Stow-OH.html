<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall.
