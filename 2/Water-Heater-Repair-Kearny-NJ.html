<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks beverages. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
