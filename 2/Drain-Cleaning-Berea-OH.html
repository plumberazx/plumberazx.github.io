Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash industry.

<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily saved for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
