<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated every year. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an every year test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring before operating the irrigation system.

<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>After removing standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then flush with warm water to clear the mix. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water coming from your water appliances? This is a great indication that your pipes might be rusting from the inside and for that reason, need to be changed. Remember that if the rust-colored water just comes with warm water, the cause could be a rusted out water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
