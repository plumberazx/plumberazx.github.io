Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a few things in a different way could have conserved her a lot of money. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
