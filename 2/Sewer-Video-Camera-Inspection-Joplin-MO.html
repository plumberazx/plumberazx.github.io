Subsequently residential licenses released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be tested each year. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be tested each year to guarantee the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.
