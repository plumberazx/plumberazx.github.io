<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
