<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
