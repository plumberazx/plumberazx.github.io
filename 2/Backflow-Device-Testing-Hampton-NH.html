<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about completely restored.</p>
