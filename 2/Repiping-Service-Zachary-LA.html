A modern-day community supply of water system is designed to guarantee that water streams to residential or commercial properties and buildings under pressure.

Each spring-loaded check valve is set to allow water at anticipated operational pressure to flow through. Ought to backflow happen, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs knock the valves shut tight, avoiding the entryway of cross contamination water.</p>
