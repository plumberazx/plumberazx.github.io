The resulting soft water is more suitable with soap and extends the life time of some home appliances. Water softening is usually attained using ion-exchange resins. The waste disposal unit is leaking from underneath your sink. Push the tip of a screwdriver up versus the edge of the plug and tap up until you break out the plug.
