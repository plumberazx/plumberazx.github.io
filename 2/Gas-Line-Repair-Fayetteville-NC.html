<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) requires plumbing contractors to acquire a plumbing permit before changing a backflow or setting up preventer. Your hot water heater. The pro will next check your water heater. With your hot water heater, she or he is looking at water temperature level, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless hot water heater ).

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
